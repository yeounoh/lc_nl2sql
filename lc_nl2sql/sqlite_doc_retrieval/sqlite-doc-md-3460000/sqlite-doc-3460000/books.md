| SQLite Forensics (2018\)  Author: Paul Sanderson Publisher: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/product/dp/1980293074)  This text by noted digital forensics expert, Paul Sanderson, provides investigators with low\-level technical details useful in analysing SQLite database files.   Every computer and phone uses hundreds of SQLite databases and there are over one trillion SQLite databases in active use. Hence, the importance of examining the data held in these databases in an investigation, including deleted data when possible, is paramount. This book fully explains the format of the SQLite database file. It shows how records are encoded, how to decode them manually and how to decode records that are partially overwritten. It also describe how the workings of SQLite, and in particular the journal and WAL, can be used to ascertain what has happened in a manner that cannot be determined from the data alone. The book covers basic SQL queries and how they can be used to create a custom report that includes data from different tables, and shows how one can use SQL queries to test hypotheses about the relationships of data in different tables.  This book is aimed mainly at forensic practitioners, and it is assumed that the reader has some basic knowledge of computer forensics; it will also be of interest to computer professionals in general particularly those who have an interest in the SQLite file format. | |

| Using SQLite (2010\)  Author: Jay A. Kreibich Publisher: O'Reilly Media [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596521196/) Developers, take note: databases aren't just for the IS group any more. You can build database\-backed applications for the desktop, Web, embedded systems, or operating systems without linking to heavy\-duty client\-server databases such as Oracle and MySQL. This book shows how you to use SQLite, a small and lightweight database that you can build right into your application during development. Applications that handle data have an enormous advantage today, and with SQLite, you'll discover how to develop a database\-backed application that remains manageable in size and complexity. This book guides you every step of the way. You'll get a crash course in data modeling, become familiar with SQLite's dialect of the SQL database language, and learn how you to work with SQLite using either a scripting language or a C\-based language, such as C\# or Objective C.Now, even relatively small and nimble applications can be a part of the data revolution. Using SQLite shows you how. | |
