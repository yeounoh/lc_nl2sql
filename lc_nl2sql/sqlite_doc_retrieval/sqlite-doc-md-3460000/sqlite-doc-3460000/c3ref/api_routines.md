## Loadable Extension Thunk




> ```
> 
> typedef struct sqlite3_api_routines sqlite3_api_routines;
> 
> ```



A pointer to the opaque sqlite3\_api\_routines structure is passed as
the third parameter to entry points of [loadable extensions](../loadext.html). This
structure must be typedefed in order to work around compiler warnings
on some platforms.

 [Objects](../c3ref/objlist.html),
