## SQLite Release 3\.8\.6 On 2014\-08\-15

1. Added support for [hexadecimal integer literals](../lang_expr.html#hexint) in the SQL parser.
 (Ex: 0x123abc)
- Enhanced the [PRAGMA integrity\_check](../pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check) command to detect [UNIQUE](../lang_createtable.html#uniqueconst) and
 [NOT NULL](../lang_createtable.html#notnullconst) constraint violations.
- Increase the maximum value of [SQLITE\_MAX\_ATTACHED](../limits.html#max_attached) from 62 to 125\.
- Increase the timeout in [WAL mode](../wal.html) before issuing an [SQLITE\_PROTOCOL](../rescode.html#protocol)
 error from 1 second to 10 seconds.
- Added the [likely(X)](../lang_corefunc.html#likely) SQL function.
- The [unicode61](../fts3.html#unicode61) tokenizer is now included in [FTS4](../fts3.html#fts4) by default.
- Trigger automatic reprepares on all prepared statements when [ANALYZE](../lang_analyze.html) is
 run.
- Added a new
 [loadable extension](../loadext.html) source code file to the source tree:
 [fileio.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/finfo?name=ext/misc/fileio.c)- Add extension functions [readfile(X) and writefile(X,Y)](../cli.html#fileio)
 (using code copy/pasted from fileio.c in the previous bullet) to the
 [command\-line shell](../cli.html).
- Added the [.fullschema](../cli.html#fullschema) dot\-command to the [command\-line shell](../cli.html).
**Performance Enhancements:**
- Deactivate the [DISTINCT](../lang_select.html#distinct) keyword on subqueries on the
 right\-hand side of the [IN operator](../lang_expr.html#in_op).
- Add the capability of evaluating an [IN operator](../lang_expr.html#in_op) as a sequence
 of comparisons as an alternative to using a table lookup. Use the sequence
 of comparisons implementation in circumstances where it is likely to be
 faster, such as when the right\-hand side of the IN operator
 is small and/or changes frequently.
- The query planner now uses [sqlite\_stat4](../fileformat2.html#stat4tab) information (created by [ANALYZE](../lang_analyze.html))
 to help determine if the [skip\-scan optimization](../optoverview.html#skipscan) is appropriate.
- Ensure that the query planner never tries to use a self\-made transient
 index in place of a schema\-defined index.
- Other minor tweaks to improve the quality of [VDBE](../opcode.html) code.
**Bug Fixes:**
- Fix a bug in [CREATE UNIQUE INDEX](../lang_createindex.html), introduced when [WITHOUT ROWID](../withoutrowid.html)
 support added in version 3\.8\.2, that allows a non\-unique NOT NULL column to be
 given a UNIQUE index.
 Ticket [9a6daf340df99ba93c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/9a6daf340df99ba93c)- Fix a bug in [R\-Tree extension](../rtree.html), introduced in the previous release,
 that can cause an
 incorrect results for queries that use the rowid of the R\-Tree on the
 left\-hand side of an [IN operator](../lang_expr.html#in_op).
 Ticket [d2889096e7bdeac6](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/d2889096e7bdeac6).
- Fix the [sqlite3\_stmt\_busy()](../c3ref/stmt_busy.html) interface so that it gives the correct answer
 for [ROLLBACK](../lang_transaction.html) statements that have been stepped but never reset.
- Fix a bug in that would cause a null pointer to be dereferenced
 if a column with a DEFAULT that is an aggregate function tried to usee its
 DEFAULT.
 Ticket [3a88d85f36704eebe1](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/3a88d85f36704eebe1)- CSV output from the [command\-line shell](../cli.html) now always uses CRNL for the
 row separator and avoids inserting CR in front of NLs contained in
 data.
- Fix a [column affinity](../datatype3.html#affinity) problem with the [IN operator](../lang_expr.html#in_op).
 Ticket [9a8b09f8e6](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/9a8b09f8e6).
- Fix the [ANALYZE](../lang_analyze.html) command so that it adds correct samples for
 [WITHOUT ROWID](../withoutrowid.html) tables in the [sqlite\_stat4](../fileformat2.html#stat4tab) table.
 Ticket [b2fa5424e6fcb15](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/b2fa5424e6fcb15).
