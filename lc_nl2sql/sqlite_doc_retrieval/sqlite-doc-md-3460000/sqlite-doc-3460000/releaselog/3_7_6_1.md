## SQLite Release 3\.7\.6\.1 On 2011\-04\-13

1. Fix a bug in 3\.7\.6 that only appears if the [SQLITE\_FCNTL\_SIZE\_HINT](../c3ref/c_fcntl_begin_atomic_write.html#sqlitefcntlsizehint)
 file control is used with a build of SQLite that makes use of the
 HAVE\_POSIX\_FALLOCATE compile\-time option and which has
 SQLITE\_ENABLE\_LOCKING\_MODE turned off.
