## SQLite Release 3\.3\.14 On 2007\-04\-02

1. Fix a bug (ticket \#2273\)
 that could cause a segfault when the IN operator
 is used one term of a two\-column index and the right\-hand side of
 the IN operator contains a NULL.
2. Added a new OS interface method for determining the sector size
 of underlying media: sqlite3OsSectorSize().
3. A new algorithm for statements of the form
 INSERT INTO *table1* SELECT \* FROM *table2*
 is faster and reduces fragmentation. VACUUM uses statements of
 this form and thus runs faster and defragments better.
4. Performance enhancements through reductions in disk I/O:
	1. Do not read the last page of an overflow chain when
	 deleting the row \- just add that page to the freelist.
	2. Do not store pages being deleted in the
	 rollback journal.
	3. Do not read in the (meaningless) content of
	 pages extracted from the freelist.
	4. Do not flush the page cache (and thus avoiding
	 a cache refill) unless another process changes the underlying
	 database file.
	5. Truncate rather than delete the rollback journal when committing
	 a transaction in exclusive access mode, or when committing the TEMP
	 database.
5. Added support for exclusive access mode using
 ["PRAGMA locking\_mode\=EXCLUSIVE"](../pragma.html#pragma_locking_mode)
6. Use heap space instead of stack space for large buffers in the
 pager \- useful on embedded platforms with stack\-space
 limitations.
7. Add a makefile target "sqlite3\.c" that builds an amalgamation containing
 the core SQLite library C code in a single file.
8. Get the library working correctly when compiled
 with GCC option "\-fstrict\-aliasing".
9. Removed the vestigal SQLITE\_PROTOCOL error.
10. Improvements to test coverage, other minor bugs fixed,
 memory leaks plugged,
 code refactored and/or recommended in places for easier reading.
