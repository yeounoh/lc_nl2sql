## SQLite Release 3\.5\.5 On 2008\-01\-31

1. Convert the underlying virtual machine to be a register\-based machine
rather than a stack\-based machine. The only user\-visible change
is in the output of EXPLAIN.
2. Add the build\-in RTRIM collating sequence.



A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.
 A detailed history of every
 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
