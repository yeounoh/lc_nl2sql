## SQLite Release 3\.0\.5 On 2004\-08\-29

1. Support for ":AAA" style bind parameter names.
2. Added the new sqlite3\_bind\_parameter\_name() interface.
3. Support for TCL variable names embedded in SQL statements in the
 TCL bindings.
4. The TCL bindings transfer data without necessarily doing a conversion
 to a string.
5. The database for TEMP tables is not created until it is needed.
6. Add the ability to specify an alternative temporary file directory
 using the "sqlite\_temp\_directory" global variable.
7. A compile\-time option (SQLITE\_BUSY\_RESERVED\_LOCK) causes the busy
 handler to be called when there is contention for a RESERVED lock.
8. Various bug fixes and optimizations
