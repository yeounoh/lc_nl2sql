## SQLite Release 3\.7\.15 On 2012\-12\-12

1. Added the [sqlite3\_errstr()](../c3ref/errcode.html) interface.
- Avoid invoking the [sqlite3\_trace()](../c3ref/profile.html) callback multiple times when a
 statement is automatically reprepared due to [SQLITE\_SCHEMA](../rescode.html#schema) errors.
- Added support for Windows Phone 8 platforms
- Enhance IN operator processing to make use of indices with numeric
 affinities.
- Do full\-table scans using covering indices when possible, under the
 theory that an index will be smaller and hence can be scanned with
 less I/O.
- Enhance the query optimizer so that ORDER BY clauses are more aggressively
 optimized, especially in joins where various terms of the ORDER BY clause
 come from separate tables of the join.
- Add the ability to implement FROM clause subqueries as coroutines rather
 that manifesting the subquery into a temporary table.
- Enhancements the command\-line shell:
	1. Added the ".print" command
	 - Negative numbers in the ".width" command cause right\-alignment
	 - Add the ".wheretrace" command when compiled with SQLITE\_DEBUG- Added the [busy\_timeout pragma](../pragma.html#pragma_busy_timeout).
- Added the [instr()](../lang_corefunc.html#instr) SQL function.
- Added the [SQLITE\_FCNTL\_BUSYHANDLER](../c3ref/c_fcntl_begin_atomic_write.html#sqlitefcntlbusyhandler) file control, used to allow VFS
 implementations to get access to the busy handler callback.
- The xDelete method in the built\-in [VFSes](../vfs.html) now return
 SQLITE\_IOERR\_DELETE\_NOENT if the file to be deleted does not exist.
- Enhanced support for QNX.
- Work around an optimizer bug in the MSVC compiler when targeting ARM.
- Bug fix: Avoid various concurrency problems in [shared cache mode](../sharedcache.html).
- Bug fix: Avoid a deadlock or crash if the [backup API](../backup.html), [shared cache](../sharedcache.html),
 and the SQLite Encryption Extension are all used at once.
- Bug fix: SQL functions created using the TCL interface honor the
 "nullvalue" setting.
- Bug fix: Fix a 32\-bit overflow problem on CREATE INDEX for databases
 larger than 16GB.
- Bug fix: Avoid segfault when using the [COLLATE operator](../lang_expr.html#collateop) inside of a
 [CHECK constraint](../lang_createtable.html#ckconst) or [view](../lang_createview.html) in [shared cache mode](../sharedcache.html).

- SQLITE\_SOURCE\_ID:
 "2012\-12\-12 13:36:53 cd0b37c52658bfdf992b1e3dc467bae1835a94ae"
- SHA1 for sqlite3\.c: 2b413611f5e3e3b6ef5f618f2a9209cdf25cbcff"
