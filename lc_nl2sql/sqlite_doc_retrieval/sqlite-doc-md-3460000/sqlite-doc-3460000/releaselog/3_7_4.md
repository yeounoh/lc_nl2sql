## SQLite Release 3\.7\.4 On 2010\-12\-07

1. Added the [sqlite3\_blob\_reopen()](../c3ref/blob_reopen.html) interface to allow an existing
 [sqlite3\_blob](../c3ref/blob.html) object to be rebound to a new row.
- Use the new [sqlite3\_blob\_reopen()](../c3ref/blob_reopen.html) interface to improve the performance
 of FTS.
- [VFSes](../c3ref/vfs.html) that do not support shared memory are allowed
 to access [WAL](../wal.html) databases if [PRAGMA locking\_mode](../pragma.html#pragma_locking_mode) is set to EXCLUSIVE.
- Enhancements to [EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN](../eqp.html).
- Added the [sqlite3\_stmt\_readonly()](../c3ref/stmt_readonly.html) interface.
- Added [PRAGMA checkpoint\_fullfsync](../pragma.html#pragma_checkpoint_fullfsync).
- Added the [SQLITE\_FCNTL\_FILE\_POINTER](../c3ref/c_fcntl_begin_atomic_write.html#sqlitefcntlfilepointer) option
 to [sqlite3\_file\_control()](../c3ref/file_control.html).
- Added support for [FTS4](../fts3.html#fts4) and enhancements
 to the FTS [matchinfo()](../fts3.html#matchinfo) function.
- Added the test\_superlock.c module which provides example
 code for obtaining an exclusive lock to a rollback or WAL database.
- Added the test\_multiplex.c module which provides
 an example VFS that provides multiplexing (sharding)
 of a DB, splitting it over multiple files of fixed size.
- A [very obscure bug](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/80ba201079)
 associated with the [or optimization](../optoverview.html#or_opt) was fixed.
