## SQLite Release 3\.19\.3 On 2017\-06\-08

**Prior changes from version 3\.19\.0 (2017\-05\-22\):**


1. The [SQLITE\_READ](../c3ref/c_alter_table.html) [authorizer callback](../c3ref/set_authorizer.html) is invoked once
 with a column name that is an empty string
 for every table referenced in a query from which no columns are extracted.
- When using an index on an expression, try to use expression values already
 available in the index, rather than loading the original columns and recomputing
 the expression.
- Enhance the [flattening optimization](../optoverview.html#flattening) so that it is able to flatten views
 on the right\-hand side of a LEFT JOIN.
- Use [replace()](../lang_corefunc.html#replace) instead of [char()](../lang_corefunc.html#char) for escaping newline and carriage\-return
 characters embedded in strings in the .dump output from the [command\-line shell](../cli.html).
- Avoid unnecessary foreign key processing in UPDATE statements that do not
 touch the columns that are constrained by the foreign keys.
- On a DISTINCT query that uses an index, try to skip ahead to the next distinct
 entry using the index rather than stepping through rows, when an appropriate
 index is available.
- Avoid unnecessary invalidation of [sqlite3\_blob](../c3ref/blob.html) handles when making
 changes to unrelated tables.
- Transfer any terms of the HAVING clause that use only columns mentioned in
 the GROUP BY clause over to the WHERE clause for faster processing.
- Reuse the same materialization of a VIEW if that VIEW appears more than
 once in the same query.
- Enhance [PRAGMA integrity\_check](../pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check) so that it identifies tables that have two
 or more rows with the same [rowid](../lang_createtable.html#rowid).
- Enhance the [FTS5](../fts5.html) query syntax so that [column filters](../fts5.html#fts5_column_filters)
 may be applied to arbitrary expressions.
- Enhance the [json\_extract()](../json1.html#jex) function to cache and reuse parses of JSON
 input text.
- Added the [anycollseq.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/anycollseq.c)
[loadable extension](../loadext.html) that allows a generic SQLite database connection to
 read a schema that contains unknown and/or
 application\-specific [collating sequences](../datatype3.html#collation).
**Bug Fixes:**
- Fix a problem in [REPLACE](../lang_replace.html) that can result in a corrupt database containing
 two or more rows with the same [rowid](../lang_createtable.html#rowid). Fix for ticket
 [f68dc596c4e6018d](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/f68dc596c4e6018d).
- Fix a problem in [PRAGMA integrity\_check](../pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check) that was causing a subsequent
 [VACUUM](../lang_vacuum.html) to behave suboptimally.
- Fix the [PRAGMA foreign\_key\_check](../pragma.html#pragma_foreign_key_check) command so that it works correctly with
 foreign keys on [WITHOUT ROWID](../withoutrowid.html) tables.
- Fix a bug in the b\-tree logic that can result in incorrect duplicate answers
 for IN operator queries. Ticket
 [61fe9745](https://sqlite.org/src/info/61fe9745)- Disallow leading zeros in numeric constants in JSON. Fix for ticket
 [b93be8729a895a528e2](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/b93be8729a895a528e2).
- Disallow control characters inside of strings in JSON. Fix for ticket
 [6c9b5514077fed34551](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/6c9b5514077fed34551).
- Limit the depth of recursion for JSON objects and arrays in order to avoid
 excess stack usage in the recursive descent parser. Fix for ticket
 [981329adeef51011052](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/981329adeef51011052).


**Prior changes from version 3\.19\.1 (2017\-05\-24\):**


1. Fix a bug in the LEFT JOIN [flattening optimization](../optoverview.html#flattening). Ticket
 [cad1ab4cb7b0fc](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/cad1ab4cb7b0fc).
- Remove a surplus semicolon that was causing problems for older versions of MSVC.


**Prior changes from version 3\.19\.2 (2017\-05\-25\):**


1. Fix more bugs in the LEFT JOIN [flattening optimization](../optoverview.html#flattening). Ticket
 [7fde638e94287d2c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7fde638e94287d2c).


**Changes in this specific patch release, version 3\.19\.3 (2017\-06\-08\):**


1. Fix a bug associated with [auto\_vacuum](../pragma.html#pragma_auto_vacuum) that can lead to database
 corruption. The bug was introduced in [version 3\.16\.0](../releaselog/3_16_0.html) (2017\-01\-02\).
