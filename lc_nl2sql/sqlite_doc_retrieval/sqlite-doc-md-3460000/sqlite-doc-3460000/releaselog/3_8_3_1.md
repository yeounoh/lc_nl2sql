 IS NOT NULL operators in the WHERE clause, when the [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT3](../compile.html#enable_stat3)
 or [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT4](../compile.html#enable_stat4) compile\-time options are used.
- Fix a harmless compiler warning that was causing problems for VS2013\.
- SQLITE\_SOURCE\_ID: "2014\-02\-11 14:52:19 ea3317a4803d71d88183b29f1d3086f46d68a00e"
