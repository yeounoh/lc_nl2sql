## SQLite Release 3\.44\.2 On 2023\-11\-24

**Prior changes from version 3\.44\.0 (2023\-11\-01\):**


1. [Aggregate functions](../lang_aggfunc.html) can now include an ORDER BY clause after their last
 parameter. The arguments to the function are processed in the order
 specified. This can be important for functions like
 [string\_agg()](../lang_aggfunc.html#group_concat) and [json\_group\_array()](../json1.html#jgrouparray).
- Add support for the [concat()](../lang_corefunc.html#concat) and [concat\_ws()](../lang_corefunc.html#concat_ws) scalar SQL functions,
 compatible with PostgreSQL, SQLServer, and MySQL.
- Add support for the [string\_agg()](../lang_aggfunc.html#group_concat) aggregate SQL function, compatible
 with PostgreSQL and SQLServer.
- New conversion letters on the [strftime() SQL function](../lang_datefunc.html#strftm): %e %F %I %k %l %p %P %R %T %u
- Add new C\-language APIs: [sqlite3\_get\_clientdata()](../c3ref/get_clientdata.html) and [sqlite3\_set\_clientdata()](../c3ref/get_clientdata.html).
- Many errors associated with CREATE TABLE are now raised when the CREATE TABLE statement
 itself is run, rather than being deferred until the first time the table is actually
 used.
- The [PRAGMA integrity\_check](../pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check) command now verifies the consistency of the
 content in various built\-in [virtual tables](../vtab.html) using the new [xIntegrity method](../vtab.html#xintegrity).
 This works for the [FTS3](../fts3.html), [FTS4](../fts3.html#fts4), [FTS5](../fts5.html), [RTREE](../rtree.html), and [GEOPOLY](../geopoly.html) extensions.
- The [SQLITE\_DBCONFIG\_DEFENSIVE](../c3ref/c_dbconfig_defensive.html#sqlitedbconfigdefensive) setting now prevents [PRAGMA writable\_schema](../pragma.html#pragma_writable_schema)
 from being turned on. Previously writable\_schema could be turned on, but would
 not actually allow the schema to be writable. Now it simply cannot be turned on.
- Tag the built\-in [FTS3](../fts3.html), [FTS4](../fts3.html#fts4), [FTS5](../fts5.html), [RTREE](../rtree.html), and [GEOPOLY](../geopoly.html) virtual tables as
 [SQLITE\_VTAB\_INNOCUOUS](../c3ref/c_vtab_constraint_support.html#sqlitevtabinnocuous) so that they can be used inside of triggers in
 high\-security deployments.
- The [PRAGMA case\_sensitive\_like](../pragma.html#pragma_case_sensitive_like) statement is deprecated, as its use when the
 schema contains LIKE operators can lead to reports of database corruption
 by [PRAGMA integrity\_check](../pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check).
- [SQLITE\_USE\_SEH](../compile.html#use_seh) (Structured Exception Handling) is now enabled by default whenever
 SQLite is built using the Microsoft C compiler. It can be disabled using
 \-DSQLITE\_USE\_SEH\=0
- Query planner optimizations:
	1. In partial index scans, if the WHERE clause implies a constant value for a table
	 column, replace occurrences of that table column with the constant. This
	 increases the likelihood of the partial index being a covering index.
	 - Disable the view\-scan optimization (added in [version 3\.42\.0](../releaselog/3_42_0.html) \- item 1c) 
	 as it was causing multiple performance regressions. In its place, reduce
	 the estimated row count for DISTINCT subqueries by a factor of 8\.- SQLite now performs run\-time detection of whether or not the underlying hardware
 supports "long double" with precision greater than "double" and uses appropriate
 floating\-point routines depending on what it discovered.
- The [CLI](../cli.html) for Windows now defaults to using UTF\-8 for both input
 and output on platforms that support it. The \-\-no\-utf8 option is available
 to disable UTF8 support.


**Prior changes from version 3\.44\.1 (2023\-11\-22\):**


1. Change the [CLI](../cli.html) so that it uses UTF\-16 for console I/O on Windows. This
 enables proper display of unicode text on old Windows7 machines.
- Other obscure bug fixes.


**Changes in this specific patch release, version 3\.44\.2 (2023\-11\-24\):**


1. Fix a mistake in the [CLI](../cli.html) that was introduced by the fix (item 15 above) in 3\.44\.1\.
- Fix a problem in FTS5 that was discovered during internal fuzz testing only
 minutes after the 3\.44\.1 release was tagged.
- Fix incomplete assert() statements that the fuzzer discovered the day after
 the previous release.
- Fix a couple of harmless compiler warnings that appeared in debug builds with GCC 16\.
