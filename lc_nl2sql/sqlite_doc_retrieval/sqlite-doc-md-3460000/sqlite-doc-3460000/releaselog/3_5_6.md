## SQLite Release 3\.5\.6 On 2008\-02\-06

1. Fix a bug (ticket \#2913\)
that prevented virtual tables from working in a LEFT JOIN.
The problem was introduced into shortly before the 3\.5\.5 release.
2. Bring the OS/2 porting layer up\-to\-date.
3. Add the new [sqlite3\_result\_error\_code()](../c3ref/result_blob.html) API and use it in the
implementation of [ATTACH](../lang_attach.html) so that proper error codes are returned
when an [ATTACH](../lang_attach.html) fails.



A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.
 A detailed history of every
 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
