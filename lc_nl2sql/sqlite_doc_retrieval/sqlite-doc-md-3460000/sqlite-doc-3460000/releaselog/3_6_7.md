## SQLite Release 3\.6\.7 On 2008\-12\-16

1. Reorganize the Unix interface in os\_unix.c
2. Added support for "Proxy Locking" on Mac OS X.
3. Changed the prototype of the [sqlite3\_auto\_extension()](../c3ref/auto_extension.html) interface in a
 way that is backwards compatible but which might cause warnings in new
 builds of applications that use that interface.
4. Changed the signature of the xDlSym method of the [sqlite3\_vfs](../c3ref/vfs.html) object
 in a way that is backwards compatible but which might cause
 compiler warnings.
5. Added superfluous casts and variable initializations in order
 to suppress nuisance compiler warnings.
6. Fixes for various minor bugs.



A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.
 A detailed history of every
 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
