## SQLite Release 3\.6\.8 On 2009\-01\-12

1. Added support for [nested transactions](../lang_savepoint.html)
2. Enhanced the query optimizer so that it is able to use
 multiple indices to efficiently process
 [OR\-connected constraints](../optoverview.html#or_opt)
 in a WHERE clause.
3. Added support for parentheses in FTS3 query patterns using the
 [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_FTS3\_PARENTHESIS](../compile.html#enable_fts3_parenthesis) compile\-time option.



A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.
 A detailed history of every
 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
