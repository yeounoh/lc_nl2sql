## SQLite Release 3\.3\.9 On 2007\-01\-04

1. Fix bugs in pager.c that could lead to database corruption if two
processes both try to recover a hot journal at the same instant
2. Added the [sqlite3\_prepare\_v2()](../c3ref/prepare.html)
API.
3. Fixed the ".dump" command in the command\-line shell to show
indices, triggers and views again.
4. Change the table\_info pragma so that it returns NULL for the default
value if there is no default value
5. Support for non\-ASCII characters in win95 filenames
6. Query optimizer enhancements:
	1. Optimizer does a better job of using indices to satisfy ORDER BY
	 clauses that sort on the integer primary key
	2. Use an index to satisfy an IS NULL operator in the WHERE clause
	3. Fix a bug that was causing the optimizer to miss an OR optimization
	 opportunity
	4. The optimizer has more freedom to reorder tables in the FROM clause
	 even in there are LEFT joins.- Extension loading supported added to WinCE
- Allow constraint names on the DEFAULT clause in a table definition
- Added the ".bail" command to the command\-line shell
- Make CSV (comma separate value) output from the command\-line shell
more closely aligned to accepted practice
- Experimental FTS2 module added
- Use sqlite3\_mprintf() instead of strdup() to avoid libc dependencies
- VACUUM uses a temporary file in the official TEMP folder, not in the
same directory as the original database
- The prefix on temporary filenames on Windows is changed from "sqlite"
to "etilqs".
