## SQLite Release 3\.2\.6 On 2005\-09\-17

1. Fix a bug that can cause database corruption if a VACUUM (or
 autovacuum) fails and is rolled back on a database that is
 larger than 1GiB
2. LIKE optimization now works for columns with COLLATE NOCASE
3. ORDER BY and GROUP BY now use bounded memory
4. Added support for COUNT(DISTINCT expr)
5. Change the way SUM() handles NULL values in order to comply with
 the SQL standard
6. Use fdatasync() instead of fsync() where possible in order to speed
 up commits slightly
7. Use of the CROSS keyword in a join turns off the table reordering
 optimization
8. Added the experimental and undocumented EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN capability
9. Use the unicode API in Windows
