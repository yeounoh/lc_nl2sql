## SQLite Release 3\.6\.9 On 2009\-01\-14

1. Fix two bugs, which when combined might result in incorrect
 query results. Both bugs were harmless by themselves; only when
 they team up do they cause problems. Ticket \#3581\.



A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.
 A detailed history of every
 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
