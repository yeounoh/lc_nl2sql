## SQLite Release 3\.6\.0 On 2008\-07\-16

1. Modifications to the [virtual file system](../c3ref/vfs.html) interface
 to support a wider range of embedded systems.
 See [35to36\.html](../35to36.html) for additional information.
 \*\*\* Potentially incompatible change \*\*\*
2. All C\-preprocessor macros used to control compile\-time options
 now begin with the prefix "SQLITE\_". This may require changes to
 applications that compile SQLite using their own makefiles and with
 custom compile\-time options, hence we mark this as a
 \*\*\* Potentially incompatible change \*\*\*
3. The SQLITE\_MUTEX\_APPDEF compile\-time option is no longer supported.
 Alternative mutex implementations can now be added at run\-time using
 the [sqlite3\_config()](../c3ref/config.html) interface with the [SQLITE\_CONFIG\_MUTEX](../c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfigmutex) verb.
 \*\*\* Potentially incompatible change \*\*\*
4. The handling of IN and NOT IN operators that contain a NULL on their
 right\-hand side expression is brought into compliance with the SQL
 standard and with other SQL database engines. This is a bug fix,
 but as it has the potential to break legacy applications that depend
 on the older buggy behavior, we mark that as a
 \*\*\* Potentially incompatible change \*\*\*
5. The result column names generated for compound subqueries have been
 simplified to show only the name of the column of the original table and
 omit the table name. This makes SQLite operate more like other SQL
 database engines.
6. Added the [sqlite3\_config()](../c3ref/config.html) interface for doing run\-time configuration
 of the entire SQLite library.
7. Added the [sqlite3\_status()](../c3ref/status.html) interface used for querying run\-time status
 information about the overall SQLite library and its subsystems.
8. Added the [sqlite3\_initialize()](../c3ref/initialize.html) and [sqlite3\_shutdown()](../c3ref/initialize.html) interfaces.
9. The [SQLITE\_OPEN\_NOMUTEX](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html) option was added to [sqlite3\_open\_v2()](../c3ref/open.html).
10. Added the [PRAGMA page\_count](../pragma.html#pragma_page_count) command.
11. Added the [sqlite3\_next\_stmt()](../c3ref/next_stmt.html) interface.
12. Added a new [R\*Tree virtual table](../rtree.html)
