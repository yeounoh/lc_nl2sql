## SQLite Release 3\.7\.3 On 2010\-10\-08

1. Added the [sqlite3\_create\_function\_v2()](../c3ref/create_function.html) interface that includes a
 destructor callback.
- Added support for [custom r\-tree queries](../rtree.html#customquery) using application\-supplied
 callback routines to define the boundary of the query region.
- The default page cache strives more diligently to avoid using memory
 beyond what is allocated to it by [SQLITE\_CONFIG\_PAGECACHE](../c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfigpagecache). Or if
 using page cache is allocating from the heap, it strives to avoid
 going over the [sqlite3\_soft\_heap\_limit64()](../c3ref/hard_heap_limit64.html), even if
 [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_MEMORY\_MANAGEMENT](../compile.html#enable_memory_management) is not set.
- Added the [sqlite3\_soft\_heap\_limit64()](../c3ref/hard_heap_limit64.html) interface as a replacement for
 [sqlite3\_soft\_heap\_limit()](../c3ref/soft_heap_limit.html).
- The [ANALYZE](../lang_analyze.html) command now gathers statistics on tables even if they
 have no indices.
- Tweaks to the query planner to help it do a better job of finding the
 most efficient query plan for each query.
- Enhanced the internal text\-to\-numeric conversion routines so that they
 work with UTF8 or UTF16, thereby avoiding some UTF16\-to\-UTF8 text
 conversions.
- Fix a problem that was causing excess memory usage with large [WAL](../wal.html)
 transactions in win32 systems.
- The interface between the VDBE and B\-Tree layer is enhanced such that
 the VDBE provides hints to the B\-Tree layer letting the B\-Tree layer
 know when it is safe to use hashing instead of B\-Trees for transient
 tables.
- Miscellaneous documentation enhancements.
