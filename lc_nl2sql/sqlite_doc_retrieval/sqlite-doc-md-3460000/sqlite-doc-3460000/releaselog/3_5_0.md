## SQLite Release 3\.5\.0 On 2007\-09\-04

1. Redesign the OS interface layer. See
 [34to35\.html](../34to35.html) for details.
 \*\*\* Potentially incompatible change \*\*\*- The [sqlite3\_release\_memory()](../c3ref/release_memory.html), [sqlite3\_soft\_heap\_limit()](../c3ref/soft_heap_limit.html),
 and [sqlite3\_enable\_shared\_cache()](../c3ref/enable_shared_cache.html) interfaces now work cross all
 threads in the process, not just the single thread in which they
 are invoked.
 \*\*\* Potentially incompatible change \*\*\*- Added the [sqlite3\_open\_v2()](../c3ref/open.html) interface.
- Reimplemented the memory allocation subsystem and made it
 replaceable at compile\-time.
- Created a new mutex subsystem and made it replicable at
 compile\-time.
- The same database connection may now be used simultaneously by
 separate threads.



A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.
 A detailed history of every
 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
