## SQLite Release 3\.1\.4 On 2005\-03\-11

1. Fix a bug in autovacuum that could cause database corruption if
a CREATE UNIQUE INDEX fails because of a constraint violation.
This problem only occurs if the new autovacuum feature introduced in
version 3\.1 is turned on.
2. The F\_FULLSYNC ioctl (currently only supported on Mac OS X) is disabled
if the synchronous pragma is set to something other than "full".
3. Add additional forward compatibility to the future version 3\.2 database
file format.
4. Fix a bug in WHERE clauses of the form (rowid\<'2')
5. New [SQLITE\_OMIT\_...](../compile.html#omitfeatures) compile\-time options added
6. Updates to the man page
7. Remove the use of strcasecmp() from the shell
8. Windows DLL exports symbols Tclsqlite\_Init and Sqlite\_Init
