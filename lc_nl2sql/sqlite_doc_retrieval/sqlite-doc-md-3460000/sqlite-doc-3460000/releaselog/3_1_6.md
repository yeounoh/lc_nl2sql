## SQLite Release 3\.1\.6 On 2005\-03\-17

1. Fix a bug that could cause database corruption when inserting
 record into tables with around 125 columns.
2. sqlite3\_step() is now much more likely to invoke the busy handler
 and less likely to return SQLITE\_BUSY.
3. Fix memory leaks that used to occur after a malloc() failure.



A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.
 A detailed history of every
 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
