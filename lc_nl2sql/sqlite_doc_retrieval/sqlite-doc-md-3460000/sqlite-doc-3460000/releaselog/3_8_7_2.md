## SQLite Release 3\.8\.7\.2 On 2014\-11\-18

1. Enhance the [ROLLBACK](../lang_transaction.html) command so that pending queries are allowed to continue as long
 as the schema is unchanged. Formerly, a ROLLBACK would cause all pending queries to
 fail with an [SQLITE\_ABORT](../rescode.html#abort) or [SQLITE\_ABORT\_ROLLBACK](../rescode.html#abort_rollback) error. That error is still returned
 if the ROLLBACK modifies the schema.
- Bug fix: Make sure that NULL results from OP\_Column are fully and completely NULL and
 do not have the MEM\_Ephem bit set.
 Ticket [094d39a4c95ee4](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/094d39a4c95ee4).
- Bug fix: The %c format in sqlite3\_mprintf() is able to handle precisions greater than 70\.
- Bug fix: Do not automatically remove the DISTINCT keyword from a SELECT that forms
 the right\-hand side of an IN operator since it is necessary if the SELECT also
 contains a LIMIT.
 Ticket [db87229497](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/db87229497).

- SQLITE\_SOURCE\_ID: "2014\-11\-18 20:57:56 2ab564bf9655b7c7b97ab85cafc8a48329b27f93"
