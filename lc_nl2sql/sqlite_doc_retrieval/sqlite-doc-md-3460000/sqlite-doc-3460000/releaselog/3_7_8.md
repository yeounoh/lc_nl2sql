## SQLite Release 3\.7\.8 On 2011\-09\-19

1. Orders of magnitude performance improvement for [CREATE INDEX](../lang_createindex.html) on
 very large tables.
- Improved the windows VFS to better defend against interference
 from anti\-virus software.
- Improved query plan optimization when the DISTINCT keyword is present.
- Allow more system calls to be overridden in the unix VFS \- to provide
 better support for chromium sandboxes.
- Increase the default size of a lookahead cache line from 100 to 128 bytes.
- Enhancements to the test\_quota.c module so that it can track
 preexisting files.
- Bug fix: Virtual tables now handle IS NOT NULL constraints correctly.
- Bug fixes: Correctly handle nested correlated subqueries used with
 indices in a WHERE clause.
- SQLITE\_SOURCE\_ID:
 "2011\-09\-19 14:49:19 3e0da808d2f5b4d12046e05980ca04578f581177"
