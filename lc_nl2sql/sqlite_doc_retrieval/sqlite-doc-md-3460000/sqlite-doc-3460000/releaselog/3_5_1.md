## SQLite Release 3\.5\.1 On 2007\-10\-04

1. ***Nota Bene:** We are not using terms "alpha" or "beta" on this
 release because the code is stable and because if we use those terms,
 nobody will upgrade. However, we still reserve the right to make
 incompatible changes to the new VFS interface in future releases.*
2. Fix a bug in the handling of [SQLITE\_FULL](../rescode.html#full) errors that could lead
 to database corruption. Ticket \#2686\.
- The test\_async.c drive now does full file locking and works correctly
 when used simultaneously by multiple processes on the same database.
- The CLI ignores whitespace (including comments) at the end of lines
- Make sure the query optimizer checks dependencies on all terms of
 a compound SELECT statement. Ticket \#2640\.
- Add demonstration code showing how to build a VFS for a raw
 mass storage without a filesystem.
- Added an output buffer size parameter to the xGetTempname() method
 of the VFS layer.
- Sticky [SQLITE\_FULL](../rescode.html#full) or [SQLITE\_IOERR](../rescode.html#ioerr) errors in the pager are reset
 when a new transaction is started.



A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.
 A detailed history of every
 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
