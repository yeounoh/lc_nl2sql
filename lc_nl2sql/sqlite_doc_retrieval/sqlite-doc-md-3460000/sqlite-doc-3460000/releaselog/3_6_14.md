## SQLite Release 3\.6\.14 On 2009\-05\-07

1. Added the optional [asynchronous VFS](../asyncvfs.html) module.
2. Enhanced the query optimizer so that [virtual tables](../vtab.html) are able to
 make use of OR and IN operators in the WHERE clause.
3. Speed improvements in the btree and pager layers.
4. Added the [SQLITE\_HAVE\_ISNAN](../compile.html#have_isnan) compile\-time option which will cause
 the isnan() function from the standard math library to be used instead
 of SQLite's own home\-brew NaN checker.
5. Countless minor bug fixes, documentation improvements, new and
 improved test cases, and code simplifications and cleanups.




A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.
 A detailed history of every
 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
