## SQLite Release 3\.7\.16\.2 On 2013\-04\-12

1. Added the [PRAGMA foreign\_key\_check](../pragma.html#pragma_foreign_key_check) command.
- Added new extended error codes for all SQLITE\_CONSTRAINT errors
- Added the SQLITE\_READONLY\_ROLLBACK extended error code for when a database
 cannot be opened because it needs rollback recovery but is read\-only.
- Added SQL functions [unicode(A)](../lang_corefunc.html#unicode) and [char(X1,...,XN)](../lang_corefunc.html#char).
- Performance improvements for [PRAGMA incremental\_vacuum](../pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum), especially in
 cases where the number of free pages is greater than what will fit on a
 single trunk page of the freelist.
- Improved optimization of queries containing aggregate min() or max().
- Enhance virtual tables so that they can potentially use an index when
 the WHERE clause contains the IN operator.
- Allow indices to be used for sorting even if prior terms of the index
 are constrained by IN operators in the WHERE clause.
- Enhance the [PRAGMA table\_info](../pragma.html#pragma_table_info) command so that the "pk" column is an
 increasing integer to show the order of columns in the primary key.
- Enhance the query optimizer to exploit transitive join constraints.
- Performance improvements in the query optimizer.
- Allow the error message from [PRAGMA integrity\_check](../pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check) to be longer than
 20000 bytes.
- Improved name resolution for deeply nested queries.
- Added the test\_regexp.c module as a demonstration of how to implement
 the REGEXP operator.
- Improved error messages in the [RTREE](../rtree.html) extension.
- Enhance the [command\-line shell](../cli.html) so that a non\-zero argument to the
 ".exit" command causes the shell to exit immediately without cleanly
 shutting down the database connection.
- Improved error messages for invalid boolean arguments to dot\-commands
 in the [command\-line shell](../cli.html).
- Improved error messages for "foreign key mismatch" showing the names of
 the two tables involved.
- Remove all uses of umask() in the unix VFS.
- Added the [PRAGMA vdbe\_addoptrace](../pragma.html#pragma_vdbe_addoptrace) and [PRAGMA vdbe\_debug](../pragma.html#pragma_vdbe_debug) commands.
- Change to use strncmp() or the equivalent instead of memcmp() when
 comparing non\-zero\-terminated strings.
- Update cygwin interfaces to omit deprecated API calls.
- Enhance the [spellfix1](../spellfix1.html) extension so that the edit distance cost table can
 be changed at runtime by inserting a string like 'edit\_cost\_table\=TABLE'
 into the "command" field.

- Bug fix: repair a long\-standing problem that could cause incorrect query
 results in a 3\-way or larger join that compared INTEGER fields against TEXT
 fields in two or more places.
 Ticket [fc7bd6358f](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/fc7bd6358f)- Bug fix: Issue an error message if the 16\-bit reference counter on a
 view overflows due to an overly complex query.
- Bug fix: Avoid leaking memory on LIMIT and OFFSET clauses in deeply
 nested UNION ALL queries.
- Bug fix: Make sure the schema is up\-to\-date prior to running pragmas
 table\_info, index\_list, index\_info, and foreign\_key\_list.


1. Fix for a bug in the ORDER BY optimizer that was introduced in
 [version 3\.7\.15](../releaselog/3_7_15.html) which would sometimes optimize out the sorting step
 when in fact the sort was required.
 Ticket [a179fe7465](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/a179fe7465)- Fix a long\-standing bug in the [CAST expression](../lang_expr.html#castexpr) that would recognize UTF16
 characters as digits even if their most\-significant\-byte was not zero.
 Ticket [689137afb6da41](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/689137afb6da41).
- Fix a bug in the NEAR operator of [FTS3](../fts3.html) when applied to subfields.
 Ticket [38b1ae018f](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/38b1ae018f).
- Fix a long\-standing bug in the storage engine that would (very rarely)
 cause a spurious report of an SQLITE\_CORRUPT error but which was otherwise
 harmless.
 Ticket [6bfb98dfc0c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/6bfb98dfc0c).
- The SQLITE\_OMIT\_MERGE\_SORT option has been removed. The merge sorter is
 now a required component of SQLite.
- Fixed lots of spelling errors in the source\-code comments


1. Fix a bug (present since version 3\.7\.13\) that could result in database corruption
 on windows if two or more processes try to access the same database file at the
 same time and immediately after third process crashed in the middle of committing
 to that same file. See ticket
 [7ff3120e4f](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7ff3120e4f) for further
 information.
