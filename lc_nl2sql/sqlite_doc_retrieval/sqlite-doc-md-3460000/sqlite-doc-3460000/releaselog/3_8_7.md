## SQLite Release 3\.8\.7 On 2014\-10\-17

**Performance Enhancements:**
- Many micro\-optimizations result in 20\.3% more work for the same number
 of CPU cycles relative to the previous release.
 The cumulative performance increase since [version 3\.8\.0](../releaselog/3_8_0.html) is 61%.
 (Measured using
 [cachegrind](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cg-manual.html) on the
 [speedtest1\.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/artifact/83f6b3318f7ee) workload on
 Ubuntu 13\.10 x64 with gcc 4\.8\.1 and \-Os. Your performance may vary.)
- The sorter can use auxiliary helper threads to increase real\-time response.
 This feature is off by default and may be
 enabled using the [PRAGMA threads](../pragma.html#pragma_threads) command or the [SQLITE\_DEFAULT\_WORKER\_THREADS](../compile.html#default_worker_threads)
 compile\-time option.
- Enhance the [skip\-scan](../optoverview.html#skipscan) optimization so that it is able to skip index terms that
 occur in the middle of the index, not just as the left\-hand side of the index.
- Improved optimization of [CAST](../lang_expr.html#castexpr) operators.
- Various improvements in how the query planner uses [sqlite\_stat4](../fileformat2.html#stat4tab)
 information to estimate plan costs.
**New Features:**
- Added new interfaces with 64\-bit length parameters:
 [sqlite3\_malloc64()](../c3ref/free.html),
 [sqlite3\_realloc64()](../c3ref/free.html),
 [sqlite3\_bind\_blob64()](../c3ref/bind_blob.html),
 [sqlite3\_result\_blob64()](../c3ref/result_blob.html),
 [sqlite3\_bind\_text64()](../c3ref/bind_blob.html), and
 [sqlite3\_result\_text64()](../c3ref/result_blob.html).
- Added the new interface [sqlite3\_msize()](../c3ref/free.html) that returns the size of a memory allocation
 obtained from [sqlite3\_malloc64()](../c3ref/free.html) and its variants.
- Added the [SQLITE\_LIMIT\_WORKER\_THREADS](../c3ref/c_limit_attached.html#sqlitelimitworkerthreads) option to [sqlite3\_limit()](../c3ref/limit.html) and
 [PRAGMA threads](../pragma.html#pragma_threads) command for configuring the number of available worker threads.
- The [spellfix1](../spellfix1.html) extension allows the application to optionally specify the rowid for
 each INSERT.
- Added the [User Authentication](https://www.sqlite.org/src/doc/trunk/ext/userauth/user-auth.txt)
 extension.
**Bug Fixes:**
- Fix a bug in the [partial index](../partialindex.html) implementation that might result in an incorrect
 answer if a partial index is used in a subquery or in a [view](../lang_createview.html).
 Ticket [98d973b8f5](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/98d973b8f5).
- Fix a query planner bug that might cause a table to be scanned in the wrong direction
 (thus reversing the order of output) when a DESC index is used to implement the ORDER BY
 clause on a query that has an identical GROUP BY clause.
 Ticket [ba7cbfaedc7e6](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/ba7cbfaedc7e6).
- Fix a bug in [sqlite3\_trace()](../c3ref/profile.html) that was causing it to sometimes fail to print
 an SQL statement if that statement needed to be re\-prepared.
 Ticket [11d5aa455e0d98f3c1e6a08](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/11d5aa455e0d98f3c1e6a08)- Fix a faulty assert() statement.
 Ticket [369d57fb8e5ccdff06f1](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/369d57fb8e5ccdff06f1)
**Test, Debug, and Analysis Changes:**
- Show ASCII\-art abstract syntax tree diagrams using the ".selecttrace"
 and ".wheretrace" commands in the
 [command\-line shell](../cli.html) when compiled with [SQLITE\_DEBUG](../compile.html#debug), SQLITE\_ENABLE\_SELECTTRACE,
 and SQLITE\_ENABLE\_WHERETRACE. Also provide the sqlite3TreeViewExpr() and
 sqlite3TreeViewSelect() entry points that can be invoked from with the
 debugger to show the parse tree when stopped at a breakpoint.
- Drop support for SQLITE\_ENABLE\_TREE\_EXPLAIN. The SELECTTRACE mechanism provides
 more useful diagnostics information.
- New options to the [command\-line shell](../cli.html) for configuring auxiliary
 memory usage: \-\-pagecache, \-\-lookaside, and \-\-scratch.
- SQLITE\_SOURCE\_ID: "2014\-10\-17 11:24:17 e4ab094f8afce0817f4074e823fabe59fc29ebb4"
- SHA1 for sqlite3\.c: 56dcf5e931a9e1fa12fc2d600cd91d3bf9b639cd
