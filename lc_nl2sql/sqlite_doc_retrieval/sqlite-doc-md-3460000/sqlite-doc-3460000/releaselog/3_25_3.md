## SQLite Release 3\.25\.3 On 2018\-11\-05

**Prior changes from version 3\.25\.0 (2018\-09\-15\):**


1. Add support for [window functions](../windowfunctions.html)- Enhancements the [ALTER TABLE](../lang_altertable.html) command:
	1. Add support for renaming columns within a table using
	 ALTER TABLE *table* RENAME COLUMN *oldname* TO *newname*.
	 - Fix table rename feature so that it also updates references
	 to the renamed table in [triggers](../lang_createtrigger.html) and [views](../lang_createview.html).- Query optimizer improvements:
	1. Avoid unnecessary loads of columns in an aggregate query that
	 are not within an aggregate function and that are not part
	 of the GROUP BY clause.
	 - The IN\-early\-out optimization: When doing a look\-up on a
	 multi\-column index and an IN operator is used on a column
	 other than the left\-most column, then if no rows match against
	 the first IN value, check to make sure there exist rows that
	 match the columns to the right before continuing with the
	 next IN value.
	 - Use the transitive property to try to propagate constant
	 values within the WHERE clause. For example, convert
	 "a\=99 AND b\=a" into "a\=99 AND b\=99".- Use a separate mutex on every inode in the unix [VFS](../vfs.html), rather than
 a single mutex shared among them all, for slightly better concurrency
 in multi\-threaded environments.
- Enhance the [PRAGMA integrity\_check](../pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check) command for improved detection
 of problems on the page freelist.
- Output infinity as 1e999 in the ".dump" command of the
 [command\-line shell](../cli.html).
- Added the [SQLITE\_FCNTL\_DATA\_VERSION](../c3ref/c_fcntl_begin_atomic_write.html#sqlitefcntldataversion) file\-control.
- Added the [Geopoly module](../geopoly.html)
**Bug fixes:**
- The ORDER BY LIMIT optimization might have caused an infinite loop
 in the byte code of the prepared statement under very obscure
 circumstances,
 due to a confluence of minor defects in the query optimizer.
 Fix for ticket
 [9936b2fa443fec03ff25](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/9936b2fa443fec03ff25)- On an UPSERT when the order of constraint checks is rearranged,
 ensure that the affinity transformations on the inserted content
 occur before any of the constraint checks. Fix for ticket
 [79cad5e4b2e219dd197242e9e](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/79cad5e4b2e219dd197242e9e).
- Avoid using a prepared statement for ".stats on" command of the
 [CLI](../cli.html) after it has been closed by the ".eqp full" logicc. Fix for ticket
 [7be932dfa60a8a6b3b26bcf76](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7be932dfa60a8a6b3b26bcf76).
- The LIKE optimization was generating incorrect byte\-code and hence
 getting the wrong answer
 if the left\-hand operand has numeric affinity and the right\-hand\-side
 pattern is '/%' or if the pattern begins with the ESCAPE character.
 Fix for ticket
 [c94369cae9b561b1f996d0054b](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/c94369cae9b561b1f996d0054b)


**Prior changes from version 3\.25\.1 (2018\-09\-18\):**


1. Extra sanity checking added to ALTER TABLE in the 3\.25\.0 release
 sometimes raises a false\-positive
 when the table being modified has a trigger that
 updates a virtual table. The false\-positive caused the ALTER
 TABLE to rollback, thus leaving the schema unchanged.
 Ticket [b41031ea2b537237](https://sqlite.org/src/info/b41031ea2b537237).
- The fix in the 3\.25\.0 release for the endless\-loop in the byte\-code
 associated with the ORDER BY LIMIT optimization did not work for
 some queries involving window functions. An additional correction
 is required. Ticket
 [510cde277783b5fb](https://sqlite.org/src/info/510cde277783b5fb)


**Prior changes from version 3\.25\.2 (2018\-09\-25\):**


1. Add the [PRAGMA legacy\_alter\_table\=ON](../pragma.html#pragma_legacy_alter_table) command that causes the
 "ALTER TABLE RENAME" command to behave as it did in SQLite versions 3\.24\.0
 and earlier: references to the renamed table inside the bodies of triggers
 and views are not updated. This new pragma provides a compatibility
 work around for older programs that expected the older, wonky behavior
 of ALTER TABLE RENAME.
- Fix a problem with the new [window functions](../windowfunctions.html) implementation that caused
 a malfunction when complicated expressions involving window functions were used
 inside of a view.
- Fixes for various other compiler warnings and minor problems associated
 with obscure configurations.


**Changes in this specific patch release, version 3\.25\.3 (2018\-11\-05\):**


1. Disallow the use of [window functions](../windowfunctions.html) in the recursive part of
 a CTE. Ticket [e8275b415a2f03bee](https://sqlite.org/src/info/e8275b415a2f03bee)- Fix the behavior of typeof() and length() on virtual tables. Ticket
 [69d642332d25aa3b7315a6d385](https://sqlite.org/src/info/69d642332d25aa3b7315a6d385)- Strengthen defenses against deliberately corrupted database files.
- Fix a problem in the query planner that results when a row\-value expression
 is used with a PRIMARY KEY with redundant columns. Ticket
 [1a84668dcfdebaf12415d](https://sqlite.org/src/info/1a84668dcfdebaf12415d)- Fix the query planner so that it works correctly for IS NOT NULL operators
 in the ON clause of a LEFT JOIN with the SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT4 compile\-time option.
