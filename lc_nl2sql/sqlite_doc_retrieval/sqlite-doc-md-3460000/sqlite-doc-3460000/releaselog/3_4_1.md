## SQLite Release 3\.4\.1 On 2007\-07\-20

1. Fix a bug in [VACUUM](../lang_vacuum.html) that can lead to
 database corruptio if two
 processes are connected to the database at the same time and one
 VACUUMs then the other then modifies the database.
2. The expression "\+column" is now considered the same as "column"
 when computing the collating sequence to use on the expression.
3. In the [TCL language interface](../tclsqlite.html),
 "@variable" instead of "$variable" always binds as a blob.
4. Added [PRAGMA freelist\_count](../pragma.html#pragma_freelist_count)
 for determining the current size of the freelist.
5. The [PRAGMA auto\_vacuum\=incremental](../pragma.html#pragma_auto_vacuum) setting is now persistent.
6. Add FD\_CLOEXEC to all open files under Unix.
7. Fix a bug in the [min()/max() optimization](../optoverview.html#minmax) when applied to
 descending indices.
8. Make sure the TCL language interface works correctly with 64\-bit
 integers on 64\-bit machines.
9. Allow the value \-9223372036854775808 as an integer literal in SQL
 statements.
10. Add the capability of "hidden" columns in virtual tables.
11. Use the macro SQLITE\_PRIVATE (defaulting to "static") on all
 internal functions in the amalgamation.
12. Add pluggable tokenizers and [ICU](https://icu.unicode.org)
 tokenization support to FTS2
13. Other minor bug fixes and documentation enhancements
