The SELECT statement is used to query the database. The
result of a SELECT is zero or more rows of data where each row
has a fixed number of columns. A SELECT statement does not make
any changes to the database.



The "[select\-stmt](syntax/select-stmt.html)" syntax diagram above attempts to show as much of the
SELECT statement syntax as possible in a single diagram, because some readers
find that helpful. The following "[factored\-select\-stmt](syntax/factored-select-stmt.html)" is an alternative
syntax diagrams that expresses the same syntax but tries to break the syntax 
down into smaller chunks.

Note that there are paths through the syntax diagrams that
are not allowed in practice. Some examples:


* A [VALUES](lang_select.html#values) clause can be the first element in a [compound SELECT](lang_select.html#compound)
 that uses a [WITH](lang_with.html) clause, but a [simple SELECT](lang_select.html#simpleselect) that consists of
 just a [VALUES](lang_select.html#values) clause cannot be preceded by a [WITH](lang_with.html) clause.
* The [WITH](lang_with.html) clause must occur on the first SELECT of a [compound SELECT](lang_select.html#compound).
 It cannot follow a [compound\-operator](syntax/compound-operator.html).


These and other similar syntax restrictions are described in the text.



The SELECT statement is the most complicated command in the SQL language.
To make the description easier to follow, some of the passages below describe
the way the data returned by a SELECT statement is determined as a series of
steps. It is important to keep in mind that this is purely illustrative \-
in practice neither SQLite nor any other SQL engine is required to follow 
this or any other specific process.




# 2\. Simple Select Processing


The core of a SELECT statement is a "simple SELECT" shown by the
[select\-core](syntax/select-core.html) and [simple\-select\-stmt](syntax/simple-select-stmt.html) syntax diagrams below. 
In practice, most SELECT statements are simple SELECT statements.

Generating the results of a simple SELECT
statement is presented as a four step process in the description below:



1. [FROM clause](lang_select.html#fromclause) processing: The input data for the simple SELECT is
 determined. The input data is either implicitly a single row with 0
 columns (if there is no FROM clause) or is determined by the FROM
 clause.
2. [WHERE clause](lang_select.html#whereclause) processing: The input data is filtered using the WHERE
 clause expression.
3. [GROUP BY, HAVING and result\-column expression](lang_select.html#resultset) processing: 
 The set of result rows is computed by aggregating the data according to
 any GROUP BY clause and calculating the result\-set expressions for the
 rows of the filtered input dataset.
4. [DISTINCT/ALL keyword](lang_select.html#distinct) processing: If the query is a "SELECT
 DISTINCT" query, duplicate rows are removed from the set of result rows.


There are two types of simple SELECT statement \- aggregate and 
non\-aggregate queries. A simple SELECT statement is an aggregate query if
it contains either a GROUP BY clause or one or more aggregate functions
in the result\-set. Otherwise, if a simple SELECT contains no aggregate
functions or a GROUP BY clause, it is a non\-aggregate query.




## 2\.1\. Determination of input data (FROM clause processing)


The input data used by a simple SELECT query is a set of *N* rows 
each *M* columns wide.



If the FROM clause is omitted from a simple SELECT statement, then the 
input data is implicitly a single row zero columns wide (i.e. *N*\=1 and
*M*\=0\).



If a FROM clause is specified, the data on which a simple SELECT query
operates comes from the one or more tables or subqueries (SELECT statements
in parentheses) specified following the FROM keyword. A subquery specified
in the table\-or\-subquery following the FROM clause in a 
simple SELECT statement is
handled as if it was a table containing the data returned by executing the
subquery statement. Each column of the subquery has the
[collation sequence](datatype3.html#collation) and [affinity](datatype3.html#affinity) of the corresponding expression
in the subquery statement.



If there is only a single table or subquery in the FROM
clause, then the input data used by the SELECT statement is the contents of the
named table. If there is more than one table or subquery in FROM clause
then the contents of all tables and/or subqueries
are joined into a single dataset for the simple SELECT statement to operate on.
Exactly how the data is combined depends on the specific [join\-operator](syntax/join-operator.html) and
[join\-constraint](syntax/join-constraint.html) used to connect the tables or subqueries together.



All joins in SQLite are based on the cartesian product of the left and
right\-hand datasets. The columns of the cartesian product dataset are, in 
order, all the columns of the left\-hand dataset followed by all the columns
of the right\-hand dataset. There is a row in the cartesian product dataset
formed by combining each unique combination of a row from the left\-hand 
and right\-hand datasets. In other words, if the left\-hand dataset consists of
*Nleft* rows of 
*Mleft* columns, and the right\-hand dataset of
*Nright* rows of
*Mright* columns, then the cartesian product is a
dataset of 
*NleftÃ—Nright*
rows, each containing 
*Mleft\+Mright* columns.



If the join\-operator is "CROSS JOIN", "INNER JOIN", "JOIN" or a comma
(",") and there is no ON or USING clause, then the result of the join is
simply the cartesian product of the left and right\-hand datasets. 
If join\-operator does have ON or USING clauses, those are handled according to
the following bullet points:



* If there is an ON clause then the ON expression is
 evaluated for each row of the cartesian product as a 
 [boolean expression](lang_expr.html#booleanexpr). Only rows for which the expression evaluates to 
 true are included from the dataset.
* If there is a USING clause
 then each of the column names specified must exist in the datasets to 
 both the left and right of the join\-operator. For each pair of named
 columns, the expression "lhs.X \= rhs.X" is evaluated for each row of
 the cartesian product as a [boolean expression](lang_expr.html#booleanexpr). Only rows for which
 all such expressions evaluates to true are included from the
 result set. When comparing values as a result of a USING clause, the
 normal rules for handling affinities, collation sequences and NULL
 values in comparisons apply. The column from the dataset on the
 left\-hand side of the join\-operator is considered to be on the left\-hand
 side of the comparison operator (\=) for the purposes of collation 
 sequence and affinity precedence.

 

For each pair of columns identified by a USING clause, the column
 from the right\-hand dataset is omitted from the joined dataset. This 
 is the only difference between a USING clause and its equivalent ON
 constraint.
* If the NATURAL keyword is in the join\-operator then an
 implicit USING clause is added to the join\-constraints. The implicit
 USING clause contains each of the column names that appear in both
 the left and right\-hand input datasets. If the left and right\-hand
 input datasets feature no common column names, then the NATURAL keyword
 has no effect on the results of the join. A USING or ON clause may
 not be added to a join that specifies the NATURAL keyword.
* If the join\-operator is a "LEFT JOIN" or "LEFT OUTER JOIN", then
 after
 the ON or USING filtering clauses have been applied, an extra row is 
 added to the output for each row in the original left\-hand input 
 dataset that does not match any row in the right\-hand dataset.
 The added rows contain NULL values in the columns
 that would normally contain values copied from the right\-hand input
 dataset.
* If the join\-operator is a "RIGHT JOIN" or "RIGHT OUTER JOIN", then
 after the ON or USING filtering clauses have been applied, an extra row is 
 added to the output for each row in the original right\-hand input 
 dataset that does not match any row in the left\-hand dataset.
 The added rows contain NULL values in the columns
 that would normally contain values copied from the left\-hand input
 dataset.
* A "FULL JOIN" or "FULL OUTER JOIN" is a combination of a
 "LEFT JOIN" and a "RIGHT JOIN". Extra rows of output are
 added for each row in left dataset that matches no rows in the right,
 and for each row in the right dataset that matches no rows in the
 left. Unmatched columns are filled in with NULL.


When more than two tables are joined together as part of a FROM clause,
the join operations are processed in order from left to right. In other 
words, the FROM clause (A join\-op\-1 B join\-op\-2 C) is computed as 
((A join\-op\-1 B) join\-op\-2 C).




## 2\.2\. Special handling of CROSS JOIN.


There is no difference between the "INNER JOIN", "JOIN" and "," join
operators. They are completely interchangeable in SQLite.
The "CROSS JOIN" join operator produces the same result as the 
"INNER JOIN", "JOIN" and "," operators, but is 
[handled differently by the query optimizer](optoverview.html#crossjoin)
in that it prevents the query optimizer from reordering
the tables in the join. An application programmer can use the CROSS JOIN 
operator to directly influence the algorithm that is chosen to implement
the SELECT statement. Avoid using CROSS JOIN except in specific situations 
where manual control of the query optimizer is desired. Avoid using
CROSS JOIN early in the development of an application as doing so is
a [premature
optimization](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization). The special handling of CROSS JOIN is an SQLite\-specific
feature and is not a part of standard SQL.




## 2\.3\. WHERE clause filtering.


If a WHERE clause is specified, the WHERE expression is evaluated for 
each row in the input data as a [boolean expression](lang_expr.html#booleanexpr). Only rows for which the
WHERE clause expression evaluates to true are included from the dataset before
continuing. Rows are excluded from the result if the WHERE clause
evaluates to either false or NULL.



For a JOIN or INNER JOIN or CROSS JOIN, there is no difference between 
a constraint expression in the WHERE clause and one in the ON clause. However,
for a LEFT or RIGHT or FULL OUTER JOIN, the difference is very important. 
In an outer join, the extra NULL rows for non\-matched rows on the other
operand are added after ON clause processing
but before WHERE clause processing. A constraint of the form "left.x\=right.y"
in an ON clause will therefore allow through for the added all\-NULL rows.
But if that same constraint is in the WHERE clause, a NULL in one of
"right.y" or "left.x" will prevent the expression "left.x\=right.y" from being true,
and thus exclude that row from the output.




## 2\.4\. Generation of the set of result rows


Once the input data from the FROM clause has been filtered by the
WHERE clause expression (if any), the set of result rows for the simple 
SELECT are calculated. Exactly how this is done depends on whether the simple 
SELECT is an aggregate or non\-aggregate query, and whether or not a GROUP
BY clause was specified.



 The list of expressions between the SELECT and FROM keywords is known as
the result expression list. If a result expression is the special expression
"\*" then all columns in the input data are substituted for that one expression.
If the expression is the alias of a table or subquery in the FROM clause
followed by ".\*" then all columns from the named table or subquery are
substituted for the single expression. It is an error to use a "\*" or
"alias.\*" expression in any context other than a result expression list.
It is also an error to use a "\*" or "alias.\*" expression in a simple SELECT
query that does not have a FROM clause.



 The number of columns in the rows returned by a simple SELECT statement
is equal to the number of expressions in the result expression list after
substitution of \* and alias.\* expressions. Each result row is calculated by
evaluating the expressions in the result expression list with respect to a
single row of input data or, for aggregate queries, with respect to a group
of rows.



* If the SELECT statement is **a non\-aggregate query**, then 
 each expression in the result expression list is evaluated for each row in
 the dataset filtered by the WHERE clause.
* If the SELECT statement is **an aggregate query without a GROUP
 BY** clause, then each aggregate expression in the result\-set is 
 evaluated once across the entire dataset. Each non\-aggregate expression
 in the result\-set is evaluated once for an arbitrarily selected row of
 the dataset. The same arbitrarily selected row is used for each
 non\-aggregate expression. Or, if the dataset contains zero rows, then 
 each non\-aggregate expression is evaluated against a row consisting
 entirely of NULL values.

 

The single row of result\-set data created by evaluating the aggregate
 and non\-aggregate expressions in the result\-set forms the result of an
 aggregate query without a GROUP BY clause. An aggregate query without a
 GROUP BY clause always returns exactly one row of data, even if there are
 zero rows of input data.
* If the SELECT statement is **an aggregate query with a GROUP
 BY** clause, then each of the expressions specified as part of the
 GROUP BY clause is evaluated for each row of the dataset according to
 the processing rules stated below for ORDER BY expressions. Each row
 is then assigned to a "group" based on the results; rows for which
 the results of evaluating the GROUP BY expressions are the same get
 assigned to the same group. For the purposes of grouping rows, NULL 
 values are considered equal. The usual rules for [selecting a
 collation sequence](datatype3.html#collation) with which to compare text values apply when evaluating
 expressions in a GROUP BY clause. The expressions in the GROUP BY clause
 do *not* have to be expressions that appear in the result. The
 expressions in a GROUP BY clause may not be aggregate expressions.

 
 

If a HAVING clause is specified, it is evaluated once for each group 
 of rows as a [boolean expression](lang_expr.html#booleanexpr). If the result of evaluating the
 HAVING clause is false, the group is discarded. If the HAVING clause is
 an aggregate expression, it is evaluated across all rows in the group. If
 a HAVING clause is a non\-aggregate expression, it is evaluated with respect
 to an arbitrarily selected row from the group. The HAVING expression may
 refer to values, even aggregate functions, that are not in the result.


Each expression in the result\-set is then evaluated once for each
 group of rows. If the expression is an aggregate expression, it is 
 evaluated across all rows in the group. Otherwise, it is evaluated against
 a single arbitrarily chosen row from within the group. If there is more
 than one non\-aggregate expression in the result\-set, then all such
 expressions are evaluated for the same row.

 

Each group of input dataset rows contributes a single row to the 
 set of result rows. Subject to filtering associated with the DISTINCT
 keyword, the number of rows returned by an aggregate query with a GROUP
 BY clause is the same as the number of groups of rows produced by applying
 the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses to the filtered input dataset.



## 2\.5\. Bare columns in an aggregate query


The usual case is that all column names in an aggregate query are either
arguments to [aggregate functions](lang_aggfunc.html) or else appear in the GROUP BY clause.
A result column which contains a column name that is not within an
aggregate function and that does not appear in the GROUP BY clause (if
one exists) is called a "bare" column.
Example:



> ```
> 
> SELECT a, b, sum(c) FROM tab1 GROUP BY a;
> 
> ```


In the query above, the "a" column is part of the GROUP BY clause
and so each row of the output contains one of the distinct values for
"a". The "c" column is contained within the [sum()](lang_aggfunc.html#sumunc) aggregate function
and so that output column is the sum of all "c" values in rows that
have the same value for "a". But what is the result of the bare 
column "b"? The answer is that the "b" result will be the
value for "b" in one of the input rows that form the aggregate.
The problem is that you usually do not know which input row is used
to compute "b", and so in many cases the value for "b" is undefined.




Special processing occurs when the aggregate function is 
either [min()](lang_aggfunc.html#min_agg) or [max()](lang_aggfunc.html#max_agg). Example:



> ```
> 
> SELECT a, b, max(c) FROM tab1 GROUP BY a;
> 
> ```


If there is exactly one [min()](lang_aggfunc.html#max_agg) or [max()](lang_aggfunc.html#min_agg) aggregate
in the query, then all bare columns in the result set take values from an
input row which also contains the minimum or maximum. So in the query
above, the value of the "b" column in the output will be the value of
the "b" column in the input row that has the largest "c" value.
There are limitations on this special behavior of
[min()](lang_aggfunc.html#max_agg) and [max()](lang_aggfunc.html#min_agg):



1. If the same minimum or maximum value occurs on two or more rows,
then bare values might be selected from any of those rows. The choice
is arbitrary. There is no way to predict from which row the bare values
will be choosen. The choice might be different for different bare columns
within the same query.
2. If there are two or more [min()](lang_aggfunc.html#min_agg) or [max()](lang_aggfunc.html#max_agg) aggregates
in the query, then bare column values will be taken from one of the rows
on which one of the aggregates has their minimum or maximum value. The choice
of which [min()](lang_aggfunc.html#min_agg) or [max()](lang_aggfunc.html#max_agg) aggregate determines the 
selection of bare column values is arbitrary. The choice might be different
for different bare columns within the same query.
3. This special processing for [min()](lang_aggfunc.html#min_agg) or [max()](lang_aggfunc.html#max_agg) aggregates
only works for the built\-in implementation of those aggregates. If an
application overrides the built\-in [min()](lang_aggfunc.html#min_agg) or [max()](lang_aggfunc.html#max_agg) aggregates
with application\-defined alternatives, then the values selected for bare
columns will be taken from an arbitrary row.


Most other SQL database engines disallow bare columns. If you include
a bare column in a query, other database engines will usually raise an error.
The ability to include bare columns in a query is an SQLite\-specific extension.
This is considered a feature, not a bug. See the discussion on 
[SQLite Forum thread 7481d2a6df8980ff](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/7481d2a6df8980ff)
for additional information.



## 2\.6\. Removal of duplicate rows (DISTINCT processing)


One of the ALL or DISTINCT keywords may follow the SELECT keyword in a 
simple SELECT statement. If the simple SELECT is a SELECT ALL, then the
entire set of result rows are returned by the SELECT. If neither ALL or
DISTINCT are present, then the behavior is as if ALL were specified. 
If the simple SELECT is a SELECT DISTINCT, then duplicate rows are removed
from the set of result rows before it is returned. For the purposes of
detecting duplicate rows, two NULL values are considered to be equal. The
[usual rules](datatype3.html#colrules) apply for selecting a collation
sequence to compare text values.




# 3\. Compound Select Statements


Two or more [simple SELECT](lang_select.html#simpleselect) statements may be connected together to form
a compound SELECT using the UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT or EXCEPT operator,
as shown by the following diagram:

In a compound SELECT, all the constituent SELECTs must return the same 
number of result columns. As the components of a compound SELECT must
be simple SELECT statements, they may not contain [ORDER BY](lang_select.html#orderby) or [LIMIT](lang_select.html#limitoffset) clauses.
[ORDER BY](lang_select.html#orderby) and [LIMIT](lang_select.html#limitoffset) clauses may only occur at the end of the entire compound
SELECT, and then only if the final element of the compound is not a [VALUES](lang_select.html#values) clause.



A compound SELECT created using UNION ALL operator returns all the rows
from the SELECT to the left of the UNION ALL operator, and all the rows
from the SELECT to the right of it. The UNION operator works the same way as
UNION ALL, except that duplicate rows are removed from the final result set.
The INTERSECT operator returns the intersection of the results of the left and
right SELECTs. The EXCEPT operator returns the subset of rows returned by the
left SELECT that are not also returned by the right\-hand SELECT. Duplicate
rows are removed from the results of INTERSECT and EXCEPT operators before the
result set is returned.



For the purposes of determining duplicate rows for the results of compound
SELECT operators, NULL values are considered equal to other NULL values and
distinct from all non\-NULL values. The collation sequence used to compare 
two text values is determined as if the columns of the left and right\-hand
SELECT statements were the left and right\-hand operands of the equals (\=)
operator, except that greater precedence is not assigned to a collation 
sequence specified with the postfix COLLATE operator. No affinity
transformations are applied to any values when comparing rows as part of a
compound SELECT. 



When three or more simple SELECTs are connected into a compound SELECT,
they group from left to right. In other words, if "A", "B" and "C" are all
simple SELECT statements, (A op B op C) is processed as ((A op B) op C).





# 4\. The ORDER BY clause


If a SELECT statement that returns more than one row does not have an
ORDER BY clause, the order in which the rows are returned is undefined.
Or, if a SELECT statement does have an ORDER BY clause, then the list of
expressions attached to the ORDER BY determine the order in which rows
are returned to the user.




In a [compound SELECT](lang_select.html#compound) statement, only the last or right\-most [simple SELECT](lang_select.html#simpleselect)
may have an ORDER BY clause. That ORDER BY clause will apply across all elements of
the compound. If the right\-most element of a [compound SELECT](lang_select.html#compound) is a [VALUES](lang_select.html#values) clause,
then no ORDER BY clause is allowed on that statement.




Rows are first sorted based on the results of
evaluating the left\-most expression in the ORDER BY list, then ties are broken
by evaluating the second left\-most expression and so on. The order in which
two rows for which all ORDER BY expressions evaluate to equal values are
returned is undefined. Each ORDER BY expression may be optionally followed
by one of the keywords ASC (smaller values are returned first) or DESC (larger
values are returned first). If neither ASC or DESC are specified, rows
are sorted in ascending (smaller values first) order by default.




SQLite considers NULL values to be smaller than any other values
for sorting purposes. Hence, NULLs naturally appear at the beginning
of an ASC order\-by and at the end of a DESC order\-by. This can be changed
using the "ASC NULLS LAST" or "DESC NULLS FIRST" syntax.



Each ORDER BY expression is processed as follows:


1. If the ORDER BY expression is a constant integer K then the
expression is considered an alias for the K\-th column of the result set
(columns are numbered from left to right starting with 1\).
2. If the ORDER BY expression is an identifier that corresponds to
the alias of one of the output columns, then the expression is considered
an alias for that column.
3. Otherwise, if the ORDER BY expression is any other expression, it 
is evaluated and the returned value used to order the output rows. If
the SELECT statement is a simple SELECT, then an ORDER BY may contain any
arbitrary expressions. However, if the SELECT is a compound SELECT, then
ORDER BY expressions that are not aliases to output columns must be exactly
the same as an expression used as an output column.


For the purposes of sorting rows, values are compared in the same way
as for [comparison expressions](datatype3.html#comparisons). The collation sequence used to compare
two text values is determined as follows:



1. If the ORDER BY expression is assigned a collation sequence using
 the postfix [COLLATE operator](lang_expr.html#collateop), then the specified collation sequence is
 used.
2. Otherwise, if the ORDER BY expression is an alias to an expression
 that has been assigned a collation sequence using the postfix 
 [COLLATE operator](lang_expr.html#collateop), then the collation sequence assigned to the aliased
 expression is used.
3. Otherwise, if the ORDER BY expression is a column or an alias of
 an expression that is a column, then the default collation sequence for
 the column is used.
4. Otherwise, the [BINARY](datatype3.html#collation) collation sequence is used.


In a [compound SELECT](lang_select.html#compound) statement, all ORDER BY expressions are handled
as aliases for one of the result columns of the compound.
If an ORDER BY expression is not an integer alias, then SQLite searches
the left\-most SELECT in the compound for a result column that matches either
the second or third rules above. If a match is found, the search stops and
the expression is handled as an alias for the result column that it has been
matched against. Otherwise, the next SELECT to the right is tried, and so on.
If no matching expression can be found in the result columns of any
constituent SELECT, it is an error. Each term of the ORDER BY clause is
processed separately and may be matched against result columns from different
SELECT statements in the compound.



# 5\. The LIMIT clause


The LIMIT clause is used to place an upper bound on the number of rows
returned by the entire SELECT statement.



In a [compound SELECT](lang_select.html#compound), only the
last or right\-most [simple SELECT](lang_select.html#simpleselect) may contain a LIMIT clause. 
In a [compound SELECT](lang_select.html#compound), 
the LIMIT clause applies to the entire compound, not just the final SELECT.
If the right\-most [simple SELECT](lang_select.html#simpleselect) is a [VALUES clause](lang_select.html#values) then no LIMIT clause
is allowed.



Any scalar expression may be used in the 
LIMIT clause, so long as it evaluates to an integer or a value that can be
losslessly converted to an integer. If the expression evaluates to a NULL 
value or any other value that cannot be losslessly converted to an integer, an
error is returned. If the LIMIT expression evaluates to a negative value,
then there is no upper bound on the number of rows returned. Otherwise, the
SELECT returns the first N rows of its result set only, where N is the value
that the LIMIT expression evaluates to. Or, if the SELECT statement would
return less than N rows without a LIMIT clause, then the entire result set is
returned. 



The expression attached to the optional OFFSET clause that may follow a
LIMIT clause must also evaluate to an integer, or a value that can be
losslessly converted to an integer. If an expression has an OFFSET clause,
then the first M rows are omitted from the result set returned by the SELECT
statement and the next N rows are returned, where M and N are the values that
the OFFSET and LIMIT clauses evaluate to, respectively. Or, if the SELECT
would return less than M\+N rows if it did not have a LIMIT clause, then the
first M rows are skipped and the remaining rows (if any) are returned. If the
OFFSET clause evaluates to a negative value, the results are the same as if it
had evaluated to zero.



Instead of a separate OFFSET clause, the LIMIT clause may specify two
scalar expressions separated by a comma. In this case, the first expression
is used as the OFFSET expression and the second as the LIMIT expression.
This is counter\-intuitive, as when using the OFFSET clause the second of
the two expressions is the OFFSET and the first the LIMIT. 
This reversal of the offset and limit is intentional
\- it maximizes compatibility with other SQL database systems.
However, to avoid confusion, programmers are strongly encouraged to use
the form of the LIMIT clause that uses the "OFFSET" keyword and avoid
using a LIMIT clause with a comma\-separated offset.




# 6\. The VALUES clause


The phrase "VALUES(*expr\-list*)" means the same thing
as "SELECT *expr\-list*". The phrase
"VALUES(*expr\-list\-1*),...,(*expr\-list\-N*)" means the same
thing as "SELECT *expr\-list\-1* UNION ALL ... UNION ALL
SELECT *expr\-list\-N*". Both forms are the same, except that
the number of SELECT statements in a compound is limited by
[SQLITE\_LIMIT\_COMPOUND\_SELECT](c3ref/c_limit_attached.html#sqlitelimitcompoundselect) whereas the number of rows in a
VALUES clause has no arbitrary limit.



There are some restrictions on the use of a VALUES clause that are
not shown on the syntax diagrams:



* A VALUES clause cannot be followed by [ORDER BY](lang_select.html#orderby).
* A VALUES clause cannot be followed by [LIMIT](lang_select.html#limitoffset).


# 7\. The WITH Clause


SELECT statements may be optionally preceded by a single
[WITH clause](lang_with.html) that defines one or more [common table expressions](lang_with.html)
for use within the SELECT statement.




# 8\. Table\-valued Functions In The FROM Clause


A [virtual table](vtab.html) that contains [hidden columns](vtab.html#hiddencol) can be used like
a [table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2) in the FROM clause. The arguments to the
table\-valued function become constraints on the HIDDEN columns of
the virtual table. Additional information can be found in the
[virtual table documentation](vtab.html#tabfunc2).




# 9\. Deviations From Standard SQL


The SELECT syntax of SQLite differs slightly from standard SQL.
These differences are due to several reasons:



* In the mid\-2000s, there was a lot of emphasis on keeping the library
 footprint as small as possible, so as not to use too much space
 on memory\-limited flip\-phones and similar.
* During the early years of SQLite, the lead developer sought to follow
 [Postel's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) and to
 be forgiving and flexible in what input was accepted.
* There were bugs in early SQLite parsers that accepts some strange inputs.
* The lead developer's knowledge of SQL was imperfect.


Whatever the origin of the input quirks, we generally avoid trying to "fix" them,
as any new restrictions on the input syntax would likely cause at least some of
the millions of applications that use SQLite to break. We do not want that.
The goal of the SQLite development team is to preserve backwards compability to
the fullest extent possible. Hence, if a syntax quirk is harmless,
we leave it alone and document it here, rather than try to fix it.



## 9\.1\. Strange JOIN names


SQLite accepts all of the usual syntax for JOIN operators:

**[join\-operator:](syntax/join-operator.html)**
hide








NATURAL





LEFT



OUTER





JOIN




,












RIGHT





FULL




INNER






CROSS








But it does not stop there. SQLite is actually very flexible in how you
specify a join operator. The general syntax is:




> *blah blah blah* **JOIN**


Where there are between 1 and 3 instances of "*blah*", each of which can be
any of "CROSS", "FULL", "INNER", "LEFT", "NATURAL", "OUTER", or "RIGHT". The SQLite
parser treats each of these keywords as an attribute of the join, which can be combined
in any order. This creates the possibility of many new and creative join types beyond
what is specified by the syntax diagram. Some of these non\-standard join types are
specifically disallowed. For example, you cannot say "INNER OUTER JOIN", because
that would be contradictory. But you can say things like "OUTER LEFT NATURAL JOIN"
which means the same as "NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN". Or you can say "LEFT RIGHT JOIN"
which is the same as "FULL JOIN".



Remember: you *can* use these non\-standard join types but you *ought not*.
Stick to using standard JOIN syntax for portability with other SQL database engines.



## 9\.2\. Flexible join syntax


Standard SQL has tighter restrictions on join syntax than does SQLite.
In standard SQL, all joins other than comma\-joins, CROSS JOINs, and NATURAL
joins must have either an ON clause or a USING clause and comma\-joins, CROSS JOINs,
and NATURAL joins must not have either an ON or USING clause. SQLite is not
nearly so fussy about join syntax. SQLite will accept and process an ON or USING clause
on a comma\-join or CROSS JOIN, and will let you omit the ON or USING
clause from any join at all. In SQLite, the only restrictions are:



* You cannot have an ON or USING clause on a NATURAL join.
* You cannot have both an ON clause and a USING clause on the same join.



SQLite even allows you to omit the ON or USING clause from an outer join,
though doing so means that the outer join is unconstrained (as if the ON clause
where "ON true") which make the outer join behave like an inner join.



## 9\.3\. Precedence of comma\-joins and CROSS JOIN


In standard SQL, joins that use the JOIN keyword take higher precedence
than comma\-joins. That is to say, JOIN operators happen before comma operators.
This is not the case in SQLite, where all joins have the same precedence.



Consider this example:




> ```
> 
> ... FROM t1, t2 NATURAL FULL JOIN t3 ...
> 
> ```


In standard SQL, the FULL JOIN between t2 and t3 would occur first, and
then the result of the left join would be cross\-joined against t1\. But SQLite
always handles all joins from left to right. Thus, SQLite will do a cross
join on t1 and t2 first, then the result of that cross join will feed into the FULL JOIN
with t3\. Inner joins are inherently associative, so the difference is only
evident if your FROM clause contains one or more outer joins.



You can work around this, and make your SQL statements portable across all
systems, by observing the following stylistic rules:



* Do not mix comma\-joins with the JOIN keyword. It is fine to use comma\-joins,
but if you do, the you should use only comma\-joins for the entire FROM clause.
* Prefer LEFT JOIN over other outer join operators.
* When in doubt, use parentheses to specify the exact join order that you intend.


Any one of these suggestions is sufficient to avoid problems, and most
programmers instinctively follow all of these suggestions without having to
be told, and so the lack of precedence difference between comma\-joins and
the JOIN keyword in SQLite rarely comes up in practice. But you should be aware
of the problem, in case it ever does appear.
