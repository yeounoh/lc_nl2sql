## SQLite Consortium Launches With Mozilla And Symbian As Charter Members


### Ensures independent technical direction for world's
most deployed SQL database engine


**Charlotte, North Carolina \- December 12, 2007** \- The SQLite Consortium,
a new membership association dedicated to maintaining SQLite as a fully open 
and independent product, was formally announced today. Mozilla and Symbian Ltd. 
have joined the SQLite Consortium as charter members.
SQLite is a compact, high efficiency, high reliability, embeddable SQL database 
engine. The source code to SQLite is in the public domain and is available with 
no associated fees. SQLite is the most deployed SQL database engine in the world 
and is currently used in a wide range of commercial software products and electronic 
devices from leading manufacturers. SQLite is found today in many mobile phones, 
MP3 players, set\-top boxes, and PCs.


The mission of the SQLite Consortium is to continue developing and enhancing
SQLite as a product that anyone may use without paying royalties or licensing fees. 
Members of the SQLite Consortium provide funding to enable this mission and in
return receive enterprise\-level technical support. Technical control and direction
of SQLite remains entirely with the SQLite developers.


Mozilla, developer of the popular open\-source Firefox web browser, and Symbian,
the market\-leading open operating system for advanced data\-enabled smartphones, 
both deploy the SQLite database engine in their products. As charter members of 
the Consortium, Mozilla and Symbian are ensuring the development and support of 
SQLite as a freely accessible and public domain software asset.


"SQLite has become a popular embedded database because it is lightweight, fast,
and open source," said Michael Schroepfer, Vice President of Engineering, Mozilla.
"As a charter member of the SQLite Consortium, Mozilla is excited to help ensure
SQLite remains a vibrant and open technology, in line with our mission to promote
choice and innovation on the Internet."


"The SQLite Consortium will help set the standards for database management 
which are essential in smartphone functionality and will also help create a pool
of developers, highly\-skilled in SQLite for future mobile phone development, "
said Bruce Carney, Director, Developer Programmes \& Services, Symbian. 
"Our involvement with the SQL Consortium not only demonstrates Symbian's commitment 
to open standards in the industry, but as mobile phones become increasingly powerful
and smartphones become increasingly popular, we are focused on ensuring that
desktop developers, who move to the mobile space, have the easiest and most
productive experience possible."


SQLite is a winner of the 2005 Google/O'Reilly Open Source Award. Additional
information regarding the SQLite Consortium is available at the SQLite website,
