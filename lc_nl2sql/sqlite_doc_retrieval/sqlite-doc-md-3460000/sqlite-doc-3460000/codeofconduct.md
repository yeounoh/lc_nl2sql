# Code of Conduct



Due to concerns raised by readers, this document has been removed.
The separate [Code of Ethics](codeofethics.html) document is similar to what this
document used to be, but with a different name. The new name is an
effort to more clearly communicate the purpose and scope of the document.


To be clear: 
The removal of this document does not represent a policy shift. Rather
the change is merely an improvement in how the policy is communicated.


For historical reference, the complete history for the source code to
this document is available in the SQLite Documentation source repository:
