## Well\-Known Users of SQLite



SQLite is used by literally millions of applications
with literally billions and billions of deployments.
SQLite is the [most widely deployed](mostdeployed.html) database engine in the
world today.


A few of the better\-known users of SQLite are shown below
in alphabetical order.
This is not a complete list.
SQLite is in the
[public domain](copyright.html) and so most
developers use it in their projects without ever telling us.

 SQLite in something that they are exporting. But nobody
 (outside of GE) seems to know what that might be.
