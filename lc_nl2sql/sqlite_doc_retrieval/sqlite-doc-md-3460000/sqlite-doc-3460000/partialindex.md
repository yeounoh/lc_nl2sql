# 1\. Introduction



A partial index is an index over a subset of the rows of a table.




In ordinary indexes, there is exactly one entry in the index for every
row in the table. In partial indexes, only some subset of the rows in the
table have corresponding index entries. For example, a partial index might
omit entries for which the column being indexed is NULL. When used 
judiciously, partial indexes can result in smaller database files and
improvements in both query and write performance.



# 2\. Creating Partial Indexes



Create a partial index by adding a WHERE clause to the end of an 
ordinary [CREATE INDEX](lang_createindex.html) statement.

Any index that includes the WHERE clause at the end is considered to be
a partial index. Indexes that omit the WHERE clause (or indexes that
are created by UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraints inside of CREATE TABLE
statements) are ordinary full indexes.




The expression following the WHERE clause may contain operators,
literal values, and names of columns in the table being indexed.
The WHERE clause may *not* contain subqueries, references to other
tables, [non\-deterministic functions](deterministic.html), or [bound parameters](lang_expr.html#varparam).



Only rows of the table for which the WHERE clause evaluates to true
are included in the index. If the WHERE clause expression evaluates 
to NULL or to false for some rows of the table, then those rows are omitted 
from the index.




The columns referenced in the WHERE clause of a partial index can be
any of the columns in the table, not just columns that happen to be
indexed. However, it is very common for the WHERE clause
expression of a partial index to be a simple expression on the column
being indexed. The following is a typical example:



```
CREATE INDEX po_parent ON purchaseorder(parent_po) WHERE parent_po IS NOT NULL;

```

In the example above, if most purchase orders do not have a "parent"
purchase order, then most parent\_po values will be NULL. That means only
a small subset of the rows in the purchaseorder table will be indexed.
Hence the index will take up much less space. And changes to the original
purchaseorder table will run faster since the po\_parent index only needs
to be updated for those exceptional rows where parent\_po is not NULL.
But the index is still useful for querying. In particular, if one wants
to know all "children" of a particular purchase order "?1", the query
would be:




```
SELECT po_num FROM purchaseorder WHERE parent_po=?1;

```

The query above will use the po\_parent index to help find the answer,
since the po\_parent index contains entries for all rows of interest.
Note that since po\_parent is smaller than a full index, the query will
likely run faster too.


## 2\.1\. Unique Partial Indexes


A partial index definition may include the UNIQUE keyword. If it
does, then SQLite requires every entry *in the index* to be unique.
This provides a mechanism for enforcing uniqueness across some subset of
the rows in a table.


For example, suppose you have a database of the members of a large
organization where each person is assigned to a particular "team". 
Each team has a "leader" who is also a member of that team. The
table might look something like this:



```
CREATE TABLE person(
  person_id       INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  team_id         INTEGER REFERENCES team,
  is_team_leader  BOOLEAN,
  -- other fields elided
);

```

The team\_id field cannot be unique because there are usually multiple people
on the same team. One cannot make the combination of team\_id and is\_team\_leader
unique since there are usually multiple non\-leaders on each team. The
solution to enforcing one leader per team is to create a unique index
on team\_id but restricted to those entries for which is\_team\_leader is
true:



```
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX team_leader ON person(team_id) WHERE is_team_leader;

```

Coincidentally, that same index is useful for locating the team leader
of a particular team:



```
SELECT person_id FROM person WHERE is_team_leader AND team_id=?1;

```

# 3\. Queries Using Partial Indexes


Let X be the expression in the WHERE clause of a partial
index, and let W be the WHERE clause of a query that uses the
table that is indexed. Then, the query is permitted to use 
the partial index if Wâ‡’X, where the â‡’ operator
(usually pronounced "implies") is the logic operator 
equivalent to "X or not W".
Hence, determining whether or not a partial index
is usable in a particular query reduces to proving a theorem in
first\-order logic.


SQLite does not have a sophisticated theorem
prover with which to determine Wâ‡’X. Instead, SQLite uses 
two simple rules to find the common cases where Wâ‡’X is true, and
it assumes all the other cases are false. The rules used by SQLite
are these:



1. If W is AND\-connected terms and X is
OR\-connected terms and if any term of W
appears as a term of X, then the partial index is usable.


For example, let the index be



```
CREATE INDEX ex1 ON tab1(a,b) WHERE a=5 OR b=6;

```

And let the query be:



```
SELECT * FROM tab1 WHERE b=6 AND a=7; -- uses partial index

```

Then the index is usable by the query because the "b\=6" term appears
in both the index definition and in the query. Remember: terms in the
index should be OR\-connected and terms in the query should be AND\-connected.


The terms in W and X must match exactly. SQLite does not
do algebra to try to get them to look the same.
The term "b\=6" does not match "b\=3\+3" or "b\-6\=0" or "b BETWEEN 6 AND 6".
"b\=6" will match to "6\=b" as long as "b\=6" is on the index and "6\=b" is
in the query. If a term of the form "6\=b" appears in the index, it will
never match anything.
2. If a term in X is of the form "z IS NOT NULL" and if a term in
 W is a comparison operator on "z" other than "IS", then those
 terms match.


Example: Let the index be



```
CREATE INDEX ex2 ON tab2(b,c) WHERE c IS NOT NULL;

```

Then any query that uses operators \=, \<, \>, \<\=, \>\=, \<\>,
IN, LIKE, or GLOB on column "c" 
would be usable with the partial index because those
comparison operators are only true if "c" is not NULL. So the following
query could use the partial index:



```
SELECT * FROM tab2 WHERE b=456 AND c<>0;  -- uses partial index

```

But the next query can not use the partial index:



```
SELECT * FROM tab2 WHERE b=456;  -- cannot use partial index

```

The latter query can not use the partial index because there might be
rows in the table with b\=456 and where c is NULL. But those rows would
not be in the partial index.


These two rules describe how the query planner for SQLite works as of
this writing (2013\-08\-01\). And the rules above will always be honored.
However, future versions of SQLite might incorporate a better theorem prover
that can find other cases where Wâ‡’X is true and thus may
find more instances where partial indexes are useful.


# 4\. Supported Versions



Partial indexes have been supported in SQLite since [version 3\.8\.0](releaselog/3_8_0.html)
(2013\-08\-26\).



Database files that contain partial indices are not readable or writable
by versions of SQLite prior to 3\.8\.0\. However, a database file created
by SQLite 3\.8\.0 is still readable and writable by prior versions as long
as its schema contains no partial indexes. A database that is unreadable
by legacy versions of SQLite can be made readable simply by running
[DROP INDEX](lang_dropindex.html) on the partial indexes.
