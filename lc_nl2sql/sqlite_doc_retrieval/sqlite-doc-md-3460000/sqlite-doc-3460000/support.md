## Public Forum


Connect with SQLite developers and other SQLite users on the
[SQLite Forum](https://sqlite.org/forum/forum). This is the preferred
way to get free help with SQLite.


There was formerly a mailing list devoted to discussions
about SQLite, but as of 2020\-03\-12, the mailing list is deprecated.
Please use the 
[SQLite Forum](https://sqlite.org/forum/forum) instead.
Historical mailing lists posts are preserved at
[www.mail\-archive.com](http://www.mail-archive.com/sqlite-users%40mailinglists.sqlite.org/)

## Proprietary SQLite Extensions


The core SQLite library found on this website is in the
[public domain](copyright.html). But there also exist
proprietary, licensed extensions to SQLite.


* The [SQLite Encryption Extension (SEE)](https://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/see.html)
will read and write database files encrypted using
128\-bit or 256\-bit AES.
* The [SQLite Compressed and Encrypted Read\-Only Database (CEROD)](https://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/cerod.html)
extension will read a database file that is both compressed
and encrypted.
* The [ZIPVFS](https://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/zipvfs.html)
extension will both read and write database files that are both compressed and optionally
encrypted using application\-supplied compression and encryption routines.
* The [Test Harness \#3 (TH3\)](th3.html) is an alternative set of test
vectors for SQLite that verify the operation of SQLite in an
as\-deployed configuration on embedded platforms with
[100% branch test coverage](testing.html#coverage).
