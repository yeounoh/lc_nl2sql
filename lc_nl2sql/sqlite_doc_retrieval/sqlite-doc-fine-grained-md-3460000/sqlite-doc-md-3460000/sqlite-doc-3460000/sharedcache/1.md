# 1\. SQLite Shared\-Cache Mode


Starting with [version 3\.3\.0](releaselog/3_3_0.html) (2006\-01\-11\),
SQLite includes a special "shared\-cache"
mode (disabled by default) intended for use in embedded servers. If
shared\-cache mode is enabled and a thread establishes multiple connections
to the same database, the connections share a single data and schema cache.
This can significantly reduce the quantity of memory and IO required by
the system.


In [version 3\.5\.0](releaselog/3_5_0.html) (2007\-09\-04\),
shared\-cache mode was modified so that the same
cache can be shared across an entire process rather than just within
a single thread. Prior to this change, there were restrictions on
passing database connections between threads. Those restrictions were
dropped in 3\.5\.0 update. This document describes shared\-cache mode
as of version 3\.5\.0\.


Shared\-cache mode changes the semantics
of the locking model in some cases. The details are described by
this document. A basic understanding of the normal SQLite locking model (see
[File Locking And Concurrency In SQLite Version 3](lockingv3.html)
for details) is assumed.
