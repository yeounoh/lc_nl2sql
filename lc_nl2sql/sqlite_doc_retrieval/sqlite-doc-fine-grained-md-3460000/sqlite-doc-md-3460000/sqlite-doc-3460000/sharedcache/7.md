## 2\.3\. Schema (sqlite\_schema) Level Locking


The [sqlite\_schema table](schematab.html) supports shared\-cache read and write
locks in the same way as all other database tables (see description
above). The following special rules also apply:



* A connection must obtain a read\-lock on *sqlite\_schema* before
accessing any database tables or obtaining any other read or write locks.
* Before executing a statement that modifies the database schema (i.e.
a CREATE or DROP TABLE statement), a connection must obtain a write\-lock on
*sqlite\_schema*.
* A connection may not compile an SQL statement if any other connection
is holding a write\-lock on the *sqlite\_schema* table of any attached
database (including the default database, "main").
