# 2\. Shared\-Cache Locking Model


Externally, from the point of view of another process or thread, two
or more [database connections](c3ref/sqlite3.html) using a shared\-cache appear as a single
connection. The locking protocol used to arbitrate between multiple
shared\-caches or regular database users is described elsewhere.

Figure 1


Figure 1 depicts an example runtime configuration where three
database connections have been established. Connection 1 is a normal
SQLite database connection. Connections 2 and 3 share a cache
The normal locking
protocol is used to serialize database access between connection 1 and
the shared cache. The internal protocol used to serialize (or not, see
"Read\-Uncommitted Isolation Mode" below) access to the shared\-cache by
connections 2 and 3 is described in the remainder of this section.



There are three levels to the shared\-cache locking model,
transaction level locking, table level locking and schema level locking.
They are described in the following three sub\-sections.
