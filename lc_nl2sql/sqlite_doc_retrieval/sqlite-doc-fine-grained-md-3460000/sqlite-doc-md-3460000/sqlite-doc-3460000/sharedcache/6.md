### 2\.2\.1\. Read\-Uncommitted Isolation Mode


The behaviour described above may be modified slightly by using the
[read\_uncommitted](pragma.html#pragma_read_uncommitted) pragma to change the isolation level from serialized
(the default), to read\-uncommitted.


 A database connection in read\-uncommitted mode does not attempt
to obtain read\-locks before reading from database tables as described
above. This can lead to inconsistent query results if another database
connection modifies a table while it is being read, but it also means that
a read\-transaction opened by a connection in read\-uncommitted mode can
neither block nor be blocked by any other connection.


Read\-uncommitted mode has no effect on the locks required to write to
database tables (i.e. read\-uncommitted connections must still obtain
write\-locks and hence database writes may still block or be blocked).
Also, read\-uncommitted mode has no effect on the [sqlite\_schema](schematab.html)
locks required by the rules enumerated below (see section
"Schema (sqlite\_schema) Level Locking").
