## 2\.1\. Transaction Level Locking


SQLite connections can open two kinds of transactions, read and write
transactions. This is not done explicitly, a transaction is implicitly a
read\-transaction until it first writes to a database table, at which point
it becomes a write\-transaction.



At most one connection to a single shared cache may open a
write transaction at any one time. This may co\-exist with any number of read
transactions.
