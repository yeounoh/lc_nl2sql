# 6\. Shared Cache And In\-Memory Databases



Beginning with SQLite [version 3\.7\.13](releaselog/3_7_13.html) (2012\-06\-11\),
shared cache can be used on
[in\-memory databases](inmemorydb.html), provided that the database is created using
a [URI filename](uri.html). For backwards compatibility, shared cache is always
disabled for in\-memory
databases if the unadorned name ":memory:" is used to open the database.
Prior to version 3\.7\.13, shared cache was always
disabled for in\-memory databases regardless of the database name used,
current system shared cache setting, or query parameters or flags.




Enabling shared\-cache for an in\-memory database allows two or more
database connections in the same process to have access to the same
in\-memory database. An in\-memory database in shared cache is automatically
deleted and memory is reclaimed when the last connection to that database
closes.
