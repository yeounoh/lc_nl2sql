## 1\.1\. Use of shared\-cache is discouraged


Shared\-cache mode is an obsolete feature. The use of shared\-cache mode
is discouraged. Most use cases for shared\-cache are better served by
[WAL mode](wal.html).



Shared\-cache mode was invented in 2006 at the request of developers
of [Symbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian). Their problem was that
if the contacts database on the phone was being synced, that would lock the
database file. Then if a call came in, the database lock would prevent them
from querying the contacts database in order to find the appropriate
ring\-tone for the incoming call, or a photo of the caller to show on screen,
and so forth.
[WAL mode](wal.html) (circa 2010\) is a better solution to this problem as it permits
simultaneous access without breaking transaction isolation.



Applications that build their own copy of SQLite from source code
are encouraged to use the [\-DSQLITE\_OMIT\_SHARED\_CACHE](compile.html#omit_shared_cache) compile\-time option,
as the resulting binary will be both smaller and faster.



The shared\-cache interfaces described here will continue to be supported
in SQLite, to insure full backwards compatibility. However, the use of
shared\-cache is discouraged.
