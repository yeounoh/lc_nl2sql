# 3\. Thread Related Issues


In SQLite versions 3\.3\.0 through 3\.4\.2 when shared\-cache mode is enabled,
a database connection may only be
used by the thread that called [sqlite3\_open()](c3ref/open.html) to create it.
And a connection could only share cache with another connection in the
same thread.
These restrictions were dropped beginning with SQLite
[version 3\.5\.0](releaselog/3_5_0.html) (2007\-09\-04\).
