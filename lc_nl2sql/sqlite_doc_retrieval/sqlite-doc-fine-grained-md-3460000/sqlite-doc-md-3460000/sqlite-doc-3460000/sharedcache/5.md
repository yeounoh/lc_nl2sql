## 2\.2\. Table Level Locking


When two or more connections use a shared\-cache, locks are used to
serialize concurrent access attempts on a per\-table basis. Tables support
two types of locks, "read\-locks" and "write\-locks". Locks are granted to
connections \- at any one time, each database connection has either a
read\-lock, write\-lock or no lock on each database table.



At any one time, a single table may have any number of active read\-locks
or a single active write lock. To read data from a table, a connection must
first obtain a read\-lock. To write to a table, a connection must obtain a
write\-lock on that table. If a required table lock cannot be obtained,
the query fails and SQLITE\_LOCKED is returned to the caller.



Once a connection obtains a table lock, it is not released until the
current transaction (read or write) is concluded.
