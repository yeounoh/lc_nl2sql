# 2\. Availability


The carray() function is not compiled into SQLite by default.
It is available as a [loadable extension](loadext.html) in the
[ext/misc/carray.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/carray.c)
source file.



The carray() function was first added to SQLite in version 3\.14
(2016\-08\-08\). The sqlite3\_carray\_bind() interface and the
single\-argument variant of carray() was added in SQLite version 3\.34\.0
(2020\-12\-01\). The ability to bind an array of struct iovec
objects that are interpreted as BLOBs was added in SQLite version 3\.41\.0
(2023\-02\-21\).
