# 4\. Usage


The carray() function can be used in the FROM clause of a query.
For example, to query two entries from the OBJ table using rowids
taken from a C\-language array at address $PTR.




```
SELECT obj.* FROM obj, carray($PTR, 10) AS x
 WHERE obj.rowid=x.value;

```

This query gives the same result:




```
SELECT * FROM obj WHERE rowid IN carray($PTR, 10);

```
