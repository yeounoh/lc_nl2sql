# 1\. Overview


Carray() is a [table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2) with a single column (named
"value") and zero or more rows.
The "value" of each row in the carray() is taken from a C\-language array
supplied by the application via [parameter binding](c3ref/bind_blob.html).
In this way, the carray() function provides a convenient mechanism to
bind C\-language arrays to SQL queries.
