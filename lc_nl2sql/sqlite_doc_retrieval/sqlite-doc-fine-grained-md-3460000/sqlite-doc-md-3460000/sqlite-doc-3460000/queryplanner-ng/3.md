## 2\.1\.  Query Planning In SQLite


SQLite computes joins using nested loops,
one loop for each table
in the join. (Additional loops might be inserted for IN
and OR operators in the WHERE clause. SQLite considers those too,
but for simplicity we will ignore them in this essay.)
One or more indexes might be used on each loop to speed the search,
or a loop might be a "full table scan" that reads every row in the
table. Thus query planning decomposes into two subtasks:


1. Picking the nested order of the various loops
2. Choosing good indexes for each loop


Picking the nesting order is generally the more challenging problem.
Once the nesting order of the join is established, the choice of indexes
for each loop is normally obvious.
