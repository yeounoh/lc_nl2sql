# 6\.  Summary


The query planner in SQLite normally does a terrific job of selecting
fast algorithms for running your SQL statements. This is true of the
legacy query planner and even more true of the new NGQP. There may be
an occasional situation where, due to incomplete information, the query
planner selects a suboptimal plan. This will happen less often with the
NGQP than with the legacy query planner, but it might still happen. Only
in those rare cases do application developers need to get involved and
help the query planner to do the right thing. In the common case, the
NGQP is just a new enhancement to SQLite that makes the application run
a little faster and which requires no new developer thought or action.
