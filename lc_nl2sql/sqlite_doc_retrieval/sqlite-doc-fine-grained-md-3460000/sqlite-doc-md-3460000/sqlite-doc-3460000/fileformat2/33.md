## 2\.5\. Representation Of SQL Indices


Each SQL index, whether explicitly declared via a [CREATE INDEX](lang_createindex.html) statement
or implied by a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint, corresponds to an 
index b\-tree in the database file.
Each entry in the index b\-tree corresponds to a single row in the 
associated SQL table.
The key to an index b\-tree is
a record composed of the columns that are being indexed followed by the
key of the corresponding table row. For ordinary tables, the row key is
the [rowid](lang_createtable.html#rowid), and for [WITHOUT ROWID](withoutrowid.html) tables the row key is the PRIMARY KEY.
Because every row in the table has a unique row key,
all keys in an index are unique.


In a normal index, there is a one\-to\-one mapping between rows in a 
table and entries in each index associated with that table.
However, in a [partial index](partialindex.html), the index b\-tree only contains entries
corresponding to table rows for which the WHERE clause expression on the
CREATE INDEX statement is true.
Corresponding rows in the index and table b\-trees share the same rowid
or primary key values and contain the same value for all indexed columns.
