### 1\.3\.6\. File change counter



The file change counter is a 4\-byte big\-endian integer at
offset 24 that is incremented whenever the database file is unlocked
after having been modified.
When two or more processes are reading the same database file, each 
process can detect database changes from other processes by monitoring 
the change counter.
A process will normally want to flush its database page cache when
another process modified the database, since the cache has become stale.
The file change counter facilitates this.


In WAL mode, changes to the database are detected using the wal\-index
and so the change counter is not needed. Hence, the change counter might
not be incremented on each transaction in WAL mode.
