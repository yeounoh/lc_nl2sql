### 2\.6\.2\. Internal Schema Objects


In addition to the tables, indexes, views, and triggers created by
the application and/or the developer using CREATE statements SQL, the
sqlite\_schema table may contain zero or more entries for 
*internal schema objects* that are created by SQLite for its 
own internal use. The names of internal schema objects
always begin with "sqlite\_" and any table, index, view, or trigger
whose name begins with "sqlite\_" is an internal schema object.
SQLite prohibits applications from creating objects whose names begin
with "sqlite\_". 



Internal schema objects used by SQLite may include the following:



* Indices with names of the form "sqlite\_autoindex\_TABLE\_N" that
 are used to implement [UNIQUE](lang_createtable.html#uniqueconst) and [PRIMARY KEY](lang_createtable.html#primkeyconst) constraints on
 ordinary tables.
* A table with the name "sqlite\_sequence" that is used to keep track
 of the maximum historical [INTEGER PRIMARY KEY](lang_createtable.html#rowid) for a table
 using [AUTOINCREMENT](autoinc.html).
* Tables with names of the form "sqlite\_statN" where N is an integer.
 Such tables store database statistics gathered by the [ANALYZE](lang_analyze.html)
 command and used by the query planner to help determine the best
 algorithm to use for each query.


New internal schema objects names, always beginning with "sqlite\_",
may be added to the SQLite file format in future releases.
