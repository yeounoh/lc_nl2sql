## 4\.3\. Checkpoint Algorithm


On a [checkpoint](wal.html#ckpt), the WAL is first flushed to persistent storage using
the xSync method of the [VFS](c3ref/io_methods.html). 
Then valid content of the WAL is transferred into the database file.
Finally, the database is flushed to persistent storage using another
xSync method call.
The xSync operations serve as write barriers \- all writes launched
before the xSync must complete before any write that launches after the
xSync begins.


A checkpoint need not run to completion. It might be that some
readers are still using older transactions with data that is contained
in the database file. In that case, transferring content for newer
transactions from the WAL file into the database would delete the content
out from under readers still using the older transactions. To avoid that,
checkpoints only run to completion if all reader are using the
last transaction in the WAL.
