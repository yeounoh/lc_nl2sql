# 1\. The Database File


The complete state of an SQLite database is usually
contained in a single file on disk called the "main database file".


During a transaction, SQLite stores additional information 
in a second file called the "rollback journal", or if SQLite is in
[WAL mode](wal.html), a write\-ahead log file.
