## 1\.7\. Cell Payload Overflow Pages


When the payload of a b\-tree cell is too large for the b\-tree page,
the surplus is spilled onto overflow pages. Overflow pages form a linked
list. The first four bytes of each overflow page are a big\-endian
integer which is the page number of the next page in the chain, or zero
for the final page in the chain. The fifth byte through the last usable
byte are used to hold overflow content.
