## Free Memory Used By A Database Connection




> ```

> int sqlite3_db_release_memory(sqlite3*);
>

The sqlite3\_db\_release\_memory(D) interface attempts to free as much heap
memory as possible from database connection D. Unlike the
[sqlite3\_release\_memory()](#sqlite3_release_memory) interface, this interface is in effect even
when the [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_MEMORY\_MANAGEMENT](compile.html#enable_memory_management) compile\-time option is
omitted.
