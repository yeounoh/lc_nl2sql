## OS Interface Open File Handle




> ```
> 
> typedef struct sqlite3_file sqlite3_file;
> struct sqlite3_file {
>   const struct sqlite3_io_methods *pMethods;  /* Methods for an open file */
> };
>

An [sqlite3\_file](#sqlite3_file) object represents an open file in the
[OS interface layer](#sqlite3_vfs). Individual OS interface
implementations will
want to subclass this object by appending additional fields
for their own use. The pMethods entry is a pointer to an
[sqlite3\_io\_methods](#sqlite3_io_methods) object that defines methods for performing
I/O operations on the open file.
