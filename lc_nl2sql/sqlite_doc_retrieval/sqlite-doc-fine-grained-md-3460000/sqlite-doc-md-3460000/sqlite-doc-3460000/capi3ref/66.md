## Find the next prepared statement




> ```
> 
> sqlite3_stmt *sqlite3_next_stmt(sqlite3 *pDb, sqlite3_stmt *pStmt);
> 
> ```



This interface returns a pointer to the next [prepared statement](#sqlite3_stmt) after
pStmt associated with the [database connection](#sqlite3) pDb. If pStmt is NULL
then this interface returns a pointer to the first prepared statement
associated with the database connection pDb. If no prepared statement
satisfies the conditions of this routine, it returns NULL.


The [database connection](#sqlite3) pointer D in a call to
[sqlite3\_next\_stmt(D,S)](#sqlite3_next_stmt) must refer to an open database
connection and in particular must not be a NULL pointer.
