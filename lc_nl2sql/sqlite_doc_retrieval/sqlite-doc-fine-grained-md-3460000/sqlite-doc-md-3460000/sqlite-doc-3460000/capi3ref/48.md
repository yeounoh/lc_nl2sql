## Find The Database Handle Of A Prepared Statement




> ```
> 
> sqlite3 *sqlite3_db_handle(sqlite3_stmt*);
> 
> ```



The sqlite3\_db\_handle interface returns the [database connection](#sqlite3) handle
to which a [prepared statement](#sqlite3_stmt) belongs. The [database connection](#sqlite3)
returned by sqlite3\_db\_handle is the same [database connection](#sqlite3)
that was the first argument
to the [sqlite3\_prepare\_v2()](#sqlite3_prepare) call (or its variants) that was used to
create the statement in the first place.
