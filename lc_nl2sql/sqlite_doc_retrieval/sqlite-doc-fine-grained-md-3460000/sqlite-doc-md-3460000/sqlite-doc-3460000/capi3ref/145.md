## Allowed return values from sqlite3\_txn\_state()




> ```
> 
> #define SQLITE_TXN_NONE  0
> #define SQLITE_TXN_READ  1
> #define SQLITE_TXN_WRITE 2
> 
> ```



These constants define the current transaction state of a database file.
The [sqlite3\_txn\_state(D,S)](#sqlite3_txn_state) interface returns one of these
constants in order to describe the transaction state of schema S
in [database connection](#sqlite3) D.




SQLITE\_TXN\_NONE
The SQLITE\_TXN\_NONE state means that no transaction is currently
pending.



SQLITE\_TXN\_READ
The SQLITE\_TXN\_READ state means that the database is currently
in a read transaction. Content has been read from the database file
but nothing in the database file has changed. The transaction state
will advanced to SQLITE\_TXN\_WRITE if any changes occur and there are
no other conflicting concurrent write transactions. The transaction
state will revert to SQLITE\_TXN\_NONE following a [ROLLBACK](lang_transaction.html) or
[COMMIT](lang_transaction.html).



SQLITE\_TXN\_WRITE
The SQLITE\_TXN\_WRITE state means that the database is currently
in a write transaction. Content has been written to the database file
but has not yet committed. The transaction state will change to
to SQLITE\_TXN\_NONE at the next [ROLLBACK](lang_transaction.html) or [COMMIT](lang_transaction.html).
