## Translate filenames




> ```
> 
> const char *sqlite3_filename_database(sqlite3_filename);
> const char *sqlite3_filename_journal(sqlite3_filename);
> const char *sqlite3_filename_wal(sqlite3_filename);
> 
> ```



These routines are available to [custom VFS implementations](vfs.html) for
translating filenames between the main database file, the journal file,
and the WAL file.


If F is the name of an sqlite database file, journal file, or WAL file
passed by the SQLite core into the VFS, then sqlite3\_filename\_database(F)
returns the name of the corresponding database file.


If F is the name of an sqlite database file, journal file, or WAL file
passed by the SQLite core into the VFS, or if F is a database filename
obtained from [sqlite3\_db\_filename()](#sqlite3_db_filename), then sqlite3\_filename\_journal(F)
returns the name of the corresponding rollback journal file.


If F is the name of an sqlite database file, journal file, or WAL file
that was passed by the SQLite core into the VFS, or if F is a database
filename obtained from [sqlite3\_db\_filename()](#sqlite3_db_filename), then
sqlite3\_filename\_wal(F) returns the name of the corresponding
WAL file.


In all of the above, if F is not the name of a database, journal or WAL
filename passed into the VFS from the SQLite core and F is not the
return value from [sqlite3\_db\_filename()](#sqlite3_db_filename), then the result is
undefined and is likely a memory access violation.
