## Low\-level system error code




> ```
> 
> int sqlite3_system_errno(sqlite3*);
> 
> ```



Attempt to return the underlying operating system error code or error
number that caused the most recent I/O error or failure to open a file.
The return value is OS\-dependent. For example, on unix systems, after
[sqlite3\_open\_v2()](#sqlite3_open) returns [SQLITE\_CANTOPEN](#SQLITE_ABORT), this interface could be
called to get back the underlying "errno" that caused the problem, such
as ENOSPC, EAUTH, EISDIR, and so forth.
