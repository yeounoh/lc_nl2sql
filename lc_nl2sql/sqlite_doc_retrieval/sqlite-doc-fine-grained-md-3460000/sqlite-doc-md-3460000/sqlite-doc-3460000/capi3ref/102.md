## User Data For Functions

The sqlite3\_user\_data() interface returns a copy of
the pointer that was the pUserData parameter (the 5th parameter)
of the [sqlite3\_create\_function()](#sqlite3_create_function)
and [sqlite3\_create\_function16()](#sqlite3_create_function) routines that originally
registered the application defined function.


This routine must be called from the same thread in which
the application\-defined function is running.
