## Synchronization Type Flags




> ```
> 
> #define SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL        0x00002

When SQLite invokes the xSync() method of an
[sqlite3\_io\_methods](#sqlite3_io_methods) object it uses a combination of
these integer values as the second argument.


When the SQLITE\_SYNC\_DATAONLY flag is used, it means that the
sync operation only needs to flush data to mass storage. Inode
information need not be flushed. If the lower four bits of the flag
equal SQLITE\_SYNC\_NORMAL, that means to use normal fsync() semantics.
If the lower four bits equal SQLITE\_SYNC\_FULL, that means
to use Mac OS X style fullsync instead of fsync().


Do not confuse the SQLITE\_SYNC\_NORMAL and SQLITE\_SYNC\_FULL flags
with the [PRAGMA synchronous](pragma.html#pragma_synchronous)\=NORMAL and [PRAGMA synchronous](pragma.html#pragma_synchronous)\=FULL
settings. The [synchronous pragma](pragma.html#pragma_synchronous) determines when calls to the
xSync VFS method occur and applies uniformly across all platforms.
The SQLITE\_SYNC\_NORMAL and SQLITE\_SYNC\_FULL flags determine how
energetic or rigorous or forceful the sync operations are and
only make a difference on Mac OSX for the default SQLite code.
(Third\-party VFS implementations might also make the distinction
between SQLITE\_SYNC\_NORMAL and SQLITE\_SYNC\_FULL, but among the
operating systems natively supported by SQLite, only Mac OSX
cares about the difference.)
