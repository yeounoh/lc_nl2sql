The xDeviceCharacteristics method of the [sqlite3\_io\_methods](#sqlite3_io_methods)
object returns an integer which is a vector of these
bit values expressing I/O characteristics of the mass storage
device that holds the file that the [sqlite3\_io\_methods](#sqlite3_io_methods)
refers to.


The SQLITE\_IOCAP\_ATOMIC property means that all writes of
any size are atomic. The SQLITE\_IOCAP\_ATOMICnnn values
mean that writes of blocks that are nnn bytes in size and
are aligned to an address which is an integer multiple of
nnn are atomic. The SQLITE\_IOCAP\_SAFE\_APPEND value means
that when data is appended to a file, the data is appended
first then the size of the file is extended, never the other
way around. The SQLITE\_IOCAP\_SEQUENTIAL property means that
information is written to disk in the same order as calls
to xWrite(). The SQLITE\_IOCAP\_POWERSAFE\_OVERWRITE property means that
after reboot following a crash or power loss, the only bytes in a
file that were written at the application level might have changed
and that adjacent bytes, even bytes within the same sector are
guaranteed to be unchanged. The SQLITE\_IOCAP\_UNDELETABLE\_WHEN\_OPEN
flag indicates that a file cannot be deleted when open. The
SQLITE\_IOCAP\_IMMUTABLE flag indicates that the file is on
read\-only media and cannot be changed even by processes with
elevated privileges.


The SQLITE\_IOCAP\_BATCH\_ATOMIC property means that the underlying
filesystem supports doing multiple write operations atomically when those
write operations are bracketed by [SQLITE\_FCNTL\_BEGIN\_ATOMIC\_WRITE](#sqlitefcntlbeginatomicwrite) and
[SQLITE\_FCNTL\_COMMIT\_ATOMIC\_WRITE](#sqlitefcntlcommitatomicwrite).
