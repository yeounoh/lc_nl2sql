## Error Logging Interface




> ```
> 
> void sqlite3_log(int iErrCode, const char *zFormat, ...);
>

The [sqlite3\_log()](#sqlite3_log) interface writes a message into the [error log](errlog.html)
established by the [SQLITE\_CONFIG\_LOG](#sqliteconfiglog) option to [sqlite3\_config()](#sqlite3_config).
If logging is enabled, the zFormat string and subsequent arguments are
used with [sqlite3\_snprintf()](#sqlite3_mprintf) to generate the final output string.


The sqlite3\_log() interface is intended for use by extensions such as
virtual tables, collating functions, and SQL functions. While there is
nothing to prevent an application from calling sqlite3\_log(), doing so
is considered bad form.


The zFormat string must not be NULL.


To avoid deadlocks and other threading problems, the sqlite3\_log() routine
will not use dynamically allocated memory. The log message is stored in
a fixed\-length buffer on the stack. If the log message is longer than
a few hundred characters, it will be truncated to the length of the
buffer.
