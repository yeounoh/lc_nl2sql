## Attempt To Free Heap Memory




> ```

> int sqlite3_release_memory(int);

The sqlite3\_release\_memory() interface attempts to free N bytes
of heap memory by deallocating non\-essential memory allocations
held by the database library. Memory used to cache database
pages to improve performance is an example of non\-essential memory.
sqlite3\_release\_memory() returns the number of bytes actually freed,
which might be more or less than the amount requested.
The sqlite3\_release\_memory() routine is a no\-op returning zero
if SQLite is not compiled with [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_MEMORY\_MANAGEMENT](compile.html#enable_memory_management).
