## Close A BLOB Handle




> ```
> 
> int sqlite3_blob_close(sqlite3_blob *);

This function closes an open [BLOB handle](#sqlite3_blob). The BLOB handle is closed
unconditionally. Even if this routine returns an error code, the
handle is still closed.


If the blob handle being closed was opened for read\-write access, and if
the database is in auto\-commit mode and there are no other open read\-write
blob handles or active write statements, the current transaction is
committed. If an error occurs while committing the transaction, an error
code is returned and the transaction rolled back.


Calling this function with an argument that is not a NULL pointer or an
open blob handle results in undefined behavior. Calling this routine
with a null pointer (such as would be returned by a failed call to
[sqlite3\_blob\_open()](#sqlite3_blob_open)) is a harmless no\-op. Otherwise, if this function
is passed a valid open blob handle, the values returned by the
sqlite3\_errcode() and sqlite3\_errmsg() functions are set before returning.
