## Flags for sqlite3\_serialize




> ```
> 
> #define SQLITE_SERIALIZE_NOCOPY 0x001   /* Do no memory allocations */
> 
> ```



Zero or more of the following constants can be OR\-ed together for
the F argument to [sqlite3\_serialize(D,S,P,F)](#sqlite3_serialize).


SQLITE\_SERIALIZE\_NOCOPY means that [sqlite3\_serialize()](#sqlite3_serialize) will return
a pointer to contiguous in\-memory database that it is currently using,
without making a copy of the database. If SQLite is not currently using
a contiguous in\-memory database, then this option causes
[sqlite3\_serialize()](#sqlite3_serialize) to return a NULL pointer. SQLite will only be
using a contiguous in\-memory database if it has been initialized by a
prior call to [sqlite3\_deserialize()](#sqlite3_deserialize).
