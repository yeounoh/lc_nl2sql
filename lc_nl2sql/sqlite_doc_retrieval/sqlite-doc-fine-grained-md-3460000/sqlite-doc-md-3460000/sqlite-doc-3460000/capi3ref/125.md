## Authorizer Return Codes




> ```
> 
> #define SQLITE_DENY   1   /* Abort the SQL statement with an error */
> #define SQLITE_IGNORE 2   /* Don't allow access, but don't generate an error */
> 
> ```



The [authorizer callback function](#sqlite3_set_authorizer) must
return either [SQLITE\_OK](#SQLITE_ABORT) or one of these two constants in order
to signal SQLite whether or not the action is permitted. See the
[authorizer documentation](#sqlite3_set_authorizer) for additional
information.


Note that SQLITE\_IGNORE is also used as a [conflict resolution mode](#SQLITE_FAIL)
returned from the [sqlite3\_vtab\_on\_conflict()](#sqlite3_vtab_on_conflict) interface.
