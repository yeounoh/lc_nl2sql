## Return The Schema Name For A Database Connection




> ```
> 
> const char *sqlite3_db_name(sqlite3 *db, int N);
> 
> ```



The sqlite3\_db\_name(D,N) interface returns a pointer to the schema name
for the N\-th database on database connection D, or a NULL pointer of N is
out of range. An N value of 0 means the main database file. An N of 1 is
the "temp" schema. Larger values of N correspond to various ATTACH\-ed
databases.


Space to hold the string that is returned by sqlite3\_db\_name() is managed
by SQLite itself. The string might be deallocated by any operation that
changes the schema, including [ATTACH](lang_attach.html) or [DETACH](lang_detach.html) or calls to
[sqlite3\_serialize()](#sqlite3_serialize) or [sqlite3\_deserialize()](#sqlite3_deserialize), even operations that
occur on a different thread. Applications that need to
remember the string long\-term should make their own copy. Applications that
are accessing the same database connection simultaneously on multiple
threads should mutex\-protect calls to this API and should make their own
private copy of the result prior to releasing the mutex.
