## File Locking Levels




> ```
> 
> #define SQLITE_LOCK_NONE          0       /* xUnlock() only */
> #define SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED        1       /* xLock() or xUnlock() */
> #define SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED      2       /* xLock() only */
> #define SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING       3       /* xLock() only */
> #define SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE     4       /* xLock() only */

SQLite uses one of these integer values as the second
argument to calls it makes to the xLock() and xUnlock() methods
of an [sqlite3\_io\_methods](#sqlite3_io_methods) object. These values are ordered from
lest restrictive to most restrictive.


The argument to xLock() is always SHARED or higher. The argument to
xUnlock is either SHARED or NONE.
