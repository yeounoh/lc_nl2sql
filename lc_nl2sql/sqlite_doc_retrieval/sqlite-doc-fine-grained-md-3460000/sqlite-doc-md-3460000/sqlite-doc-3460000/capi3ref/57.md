## Enable Or Disable Extension Loading




> ```
> 
> int sqlite3_enable_load_extension(sqlite3 *db, int onoff);
>

So as not to open security holes in older applications that are
unprepared to deal with [extension loading](loadext.html), and as a means of disabling
[extension loading](loadext.html) while evaluating user\-entered SQL, the following API
is provided to turn the [sqlite3\_load\_extension()](#sqlite3_load_extension) mechanism on and off.


Extension loading is off by default.
Call the sqlite3\_enable\_load\_extension() routine with onoff\=\=1
to turn extension loading on and call it with onoff\=\=0 to turn
it back off again.


This interface enables or disables both the C\-API
[sqlite3\_load\_extension()](#sqlite3_load_extension) and the SQL function [load\_extension()](lang_corefunc.html#load_extension).
Use [sqlite3\_db\_config](#sqlite3_db_config)(db,[SQLITE\_DBCONFIG\_ENABLE\_LOAD\_EXTENSION](#sqlitedbconfigenableloadextension),..)
to enable or disable only the C\-API.


**Security warning:** It is recommended that extension loading
be enabled using the [SQLITE\_DBCONFIG\_ENABLE\_LOAD\_EXTENSION](#sqlitedbconfigenableloadextension) method
rather than this interface, so the [load\_extension()](lang_corefunc.html#load_extension) SQL function
remains disabled. This will prevent SQL injections from giving attackers
access to extension loading capabilities.
