## Determine If A Prepared Statement Has Been Reset




> ```

The sqlite3\_stmt\_busy(S) interface returns true (non\-zero) if the
[prepared statement](#sqlite3_stmt) S has been stepped at least once using
[sqlite3\_step(S)](#sqlite3_step) but has neither run to completion (returned
[SQLITE\_DONE](#SQLITE_ABORT) from [sqlite3\_step(S)](#sqlite3_step)) nor
been reset using [sqlite3\_reset(S)](#sqlite3_reset). The sqlite3\_stmt\_busy(S)
interface returns false if S is a NULL pointer. If S is not a
NULL pointer and is not a pointer to a valid [prepared statement](#sqlite3_stmt)
object, then the behavior is undefined and probably undesirable.


This interface can be used in combination [sqlite3\_next\_stmt()](#sqlite3_next_stmt)
to locate all prepared statements associated with a database
connection that are in need of being reset. This can be used,
for example, in diagnostic routines to search for prepared
statements that are holding a transaction open.
