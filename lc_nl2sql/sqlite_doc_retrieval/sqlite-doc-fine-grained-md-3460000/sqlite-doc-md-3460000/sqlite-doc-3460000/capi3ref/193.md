### URI filename examples






| URI filenames  Results | file:data.db  Open the file "data.db" in the current directory. | file:/home/fred/data.db file:///home/fred/data.db  file://localhost/home/fred/data.db  Open the database file "/home/fred/data.db". | file://darkstar/home/fred/data.db  An error. "darkstar" is not a recognized authority. | file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/fred/Desktop/data.db  Windows only: Open the file "data.db" on fred's desktop on drive C:. Note that the %20 escaping in this example is not strictly necessary \- space characters can be used literally in URI filenames. | file:data.db?mode\=ro\&cache\=private  Open file "data.db" in the current directory for read\-only access. Regardless of whether or not shared\-cache mode is enabled by default, use a private cache. | file:/home/fred/data.db?vfs\=unix\-dotfile  Open file "/home/fred/data.db". Use the special VFS "unix\-dotfile" that uses dot\-files in place of posix advisory locking. | file:data.db?mode\=readonly  An error. "readonly" is not a valid option for the "mode" parameter. Use "ro" instead: "file:data.db?mode\=ro". | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

URI hexadecimal escape sequences (%HH) are supported within the path and
query components of a URI. A hexadecimal escape sequence consists of a
percent sign \- "%" \- followed by exactly two hexadecimal digits
specifying an octet value. Before the path or query components of a
URI filename are interpreted, they are encoded using UTF\-8 and all
hexadecimal escape sequences replaced by a single byte containing the
corresponding octet. If this process generates an invalid UTF\-8 encoding,
the results are undefined.


**Note to Windows users:** The encoding used for the filename argument
of sqlite3\_open() and sqlite3\_open\_v2() must be UTF\-8, not whatever
codepage is currently defined. Filenames containing international
characters must be converted to UTF\-8 prior to passing them into
sqlite3\_open() or sqlite3\_open\_v2().


**Note to Windows Runtime users:** The temporary directory must be set
prior to calling sqlite3\_open() or sqlite3\_open\_v2(). Otherwise, various
features that require the use of temporary files may fail.
