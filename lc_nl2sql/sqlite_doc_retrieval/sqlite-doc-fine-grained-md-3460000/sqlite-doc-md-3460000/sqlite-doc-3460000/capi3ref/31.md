## Return The Size Of An Open BLOB

Returns the size in bytes of the BLOB accessible via the
successfully opened [BLOB handle](#sqlite3_blob) in its only argument. The
incremental blob I/O routines can only read or overwriting existing
blob content; they cannot change the size of a blob.


This routine only works on a [BLOB handle](#sqlite3_blob) which has been created
by a prior successful call to [sqlite3\_blob\_open()](#sqlite3_blob_open) and which has not
been closed by [sqlite3\_blob\_close()](#sqlite3_blob_close). Passing any other pointer in
to this routine results in undefined and probably undesirable behavior.
