## Database File Corresponding To A Journal




> ```
> 
> sqlite3_file *sqlite3_database_file_object(const char*);

If X is the name of a rollback or WAL\-mode journal file that is
passed into the xOpen method of [sqlite3\_vfs](#sqlite3_vfs), then
sqlite3\_database\_file\_object(X) returns a pointer to the [sqlite3\_file](#sqlite3_file)
object that represents the main database file.


This routine is intended for use in custom [VFS](vfs.html) implementations
only. It is not a general\-purpose interface.
The argument sqlite3\_file\_object(X) must be a filename pointer that
has been passed into [sqlite3\_vfs](#sqlite3_vfs).xOpen method where the
flags parameter to xOpen contains one of the bits
[SQLITE\_OPEN\_MAIN\_JOURNAL](#SQLITE_OPEN_AUTOPROXY) or [SQLITE\_OPEN\_WAL](#SQLITE_OPEN_AUTOPROXY). Any other use
of this routine results in undefined and probably undesirable
behavior.
