## 2\.0 Not a Compatibility Break



These changes in the default behavior of SQLite are not
a compatibility break. All legacy database files continue to be
readable and writable by newer versions of SQLite, and all newly
created database files continue to be readable and writable by
legacy versions of the SQLite library. The only thing that is changing
is some default settings. This should result in a performance
increase for many applications.




Though most application should not notice any change (except that
they run a little faster), if problems arise then the
legacy behavior can be restored at compile\-time by using the
following options to the C\-compiler:


> ```
> 
> -DSQLITE_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=1024 
> -DSQLITE_DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE=2000
> 
> ```



The page size and cache size can also be set or changed at run\-time using the
[page\_size pragma](pragma.html#pragma_page_size) and [cache\_size pragma](pragma.html#pragma_cache_size), respectively.
