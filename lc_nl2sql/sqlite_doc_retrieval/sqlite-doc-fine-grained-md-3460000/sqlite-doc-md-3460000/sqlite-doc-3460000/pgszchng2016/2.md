## 1\.0 Introduction



An SQLite database file consists of one or more "pages".
For a single database file, all pages are the same size, though
for different database files, the page size can any power of
two between 512 and 65536, inclusive.




Since the SQLite database file format was designed (in 2003\) the
default [page size](pragma.html#pragma_page_size) for new databases has been 1024 bytes. 
This was a reasonable choice in 2003\. But on modern hardware, 
a 4096 byte page is a faster and better choice.
So, beginning with SQLite [version 3\.12\.0](releaselog/3_12_0.html) (2016\-03\-29\)) the default 
page size for new database files has been increased to 4096 bytes.




The upper bound on the database [cache size](pragma.html#pragma_cache_size) has 
traditionally defaulted to 2000 pages. SQLite [version 3\.12\.0](releaselog/3_12_0.html) also
changes this default setting to be "\-2000" which means 2000\*1024
bytes, regardless of page size. So, the upper bound on the amount
of memory used for the page cache is unchanged.
