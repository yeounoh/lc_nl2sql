## 3\.0 Possible Negative Consequences Of This Change



The minimum size of an SQLite database is one page for each table and
each index. With a larger page size, the size of an empty database
for a given schema will grow by a factor of four, therefore. However,
once the database begins to fill with content the size of the older
1024\-byte page databases and the newer 4096\-byte page databases will
quickly converge. Due to relaxed bin\-packing constraints, the 
4096\-byte page size might actually result in a smaller file, once
substantial content is added.
