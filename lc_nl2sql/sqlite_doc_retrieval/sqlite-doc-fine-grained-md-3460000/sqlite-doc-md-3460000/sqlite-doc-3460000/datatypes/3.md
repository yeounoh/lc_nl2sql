### 2\.0 Â  The INTEGER PRIMARY KEY



One exception to the typelessness of SQLite is a column whose type
is INTEGER PRIMARY KEY. (And you must use "INTEGER" not "INT".
A column of type INT PRIMARY KEY is typeless just like any other.)
INTEGER PRIMARY KEY columns must contain a 32\-bit signed integer. Any
attempt to insert non\-integer data will result in an error.




INTEGER PRIMARY KEY columns can be used to implement the equivalent
of AUTOINCREMENT. If you try to insert a NULL into an INTEGER PRIMARY
KEY column, the column will actually be filled with an integer that is
one greater than the largest key already in the table. Or if the
largest key is 2147483647, then the column will be filled with a
random integer. Either way, the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY column will be
assigned a unique integer. You can retrieve this integer using
the **sqlite\_last\_insert\_rowid()** API function or using the
**last\_insert\_rowid()** SQL function in a subsequent SELECT statement.
