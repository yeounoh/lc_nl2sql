## 1\.4\. Stability



The C language is old and boring.
It is a well\-known and well\-understood language.
This is exactly what one wants when developing a module like SQLite.
Writing a small, fast, and reliable database engine is hard enough as it
is without the implementation language changing out from under you with
each update to the implementation language specification.
