## 1\.3\. Low\-Dependency


Libraries written in C do not have a huge run\-time dependency.
In its minimum configuration, SQLite requires only the following
routines from the standard C library:






| * memcmp() * memcpy() * memmove() * memset() |  | * strcmp() * strlen() * strncmp() |
| --- | --- | --- |




In a more complete build, SQLite also uses library routines like
malloc() and free() and operating system interfaces for opening, reading,
writing, and closing files. But even then, the number of dependencies
is very small. Other "modern" language, in contrast, often require
multi\-megabyte runtimes loaded with thousands and thousands of interfaces.
