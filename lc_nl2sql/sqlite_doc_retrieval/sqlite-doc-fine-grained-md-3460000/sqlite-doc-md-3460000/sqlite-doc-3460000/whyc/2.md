## 1\.1\. Performance


An intensively used low\-level library like SQLite needs to be fast.
(And SQLite is fast, see [Internal Versus External BLOBs](intern-v-extern-blob.html) and
[35% Faster Than The Filesystem](fasterthanfs.html) for example.)



C is a great language for writing fast code. C is sometimes
described as "portable assembly language". It enables to developers
to code as close to the underlying hardware as possible while still
remaining portable across platforms.



Other programming languages sometimes claim to be "as fast as C".
But no other language claims to be faster than C for general\-purpose
programming, because none are.
