## 1\.2\. Compatibility


Nearly all systems have the ability to call libraries
written in C. This is not true of other implementation languages.



So, for example, Android applications written in Java are able to
invoke SQLite (through an adaptor). Maybe it would have been more
convenient for Android if SQLite had been coded in Java as that would
make the interface simpler. However, on iPhone applications are coded
in Objective\-C or Swift, neither of which have the ability to call
libraries written in Java. Thus, SQLite would be unusable on iPhones
had it been written in Java.
