Since its inception on 2000\-05\-29, SQLite has been implemented in generic C.
C was and continues to be the best language for implementing a software
library like SQLite. There are no plans to recode SQLite in any other
programming language at this time.




The reasons why C is the best language to implement SQLite include:




* Performance
* Compatibility
* Low\-dependency
* Stability
