## 2\.4\. B\-Tree Cursors


A prepared statement can have
zero or more open cursors. Each cursor is identified by a
small integer, which is usually the P1 parameter to the opcode
that uses the cursor.
There can be multiple cursors open on the same index or table.
All cursors operate independently, even cursors pointing to the same
indices or tables.
The only way for the virtual machine to interact with a database
file is through a cursor.
Instructions in the virtual machine can create a new cursor 
(ex: [OpenRead](opcode.html#OpenRead) or [OpenWrite](opcode.html#OpenWrite)),
read data from a cursor ([Column](opcode.html#Column)),
advance the cursor to the next entry in the table
(ex: [Next](opcode.html#Next) or [Prev](opcode.html#Prev)), and so forth.
All cursors are automatically
closed when the prepared statement is [reset](c3ref/reset.html) or
[finalized](c3ref/finalize.html).
