# 1\. Executive Summary


SQLite works by translating SQL statements into bytecode and
then running that bytecode in a virtual machine. This document
describes how the bytecode engine works.



This document describes SQLite internals. The information provided
here is not needed for routine application development using SQLite.
This document is intended for people who want to delve more deeply into
the internal operation of SQLite.



The bytecode engine is not an API of SQLite. Details
about the bytecode engine change from one release of SQLite to the next.
Applications that use SQLite should not depend on any of the details
found in this document.



See the document "[Why SQLite Uses Bytecode](whybytecode.html)" for some reasons why
SQLite prefers to use bytecode to implement SQL.
