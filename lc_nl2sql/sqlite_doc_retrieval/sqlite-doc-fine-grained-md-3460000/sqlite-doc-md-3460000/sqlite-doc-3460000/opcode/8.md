## 2\.6\. Self\-Altering Code


Some opcodes are self\-altering.
For example, the [Init](opcode.html#Init) opcode (which is always the first opcode
in every bytecode program) increments its P1 operand. Subsequent
[Once](opcode.html#Once) opcodes compare their P1 operands to the P1 value for
the [Init](opcode.html#Init) opcode in order to determine if the one\-time initialization
code that follows should be skipped.
Another example is the [String8](opcode.html#String8) opcode which converts its P4
operand from UTF\-8 into the correct database string encoding, then
converts itself into a [String](opcode.html#String) opcode.
