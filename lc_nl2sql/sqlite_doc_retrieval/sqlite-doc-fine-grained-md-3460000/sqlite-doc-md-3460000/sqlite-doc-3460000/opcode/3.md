## 2\.1\. VDBE Source Code


The source code to the bytecode engine is in the
[vdbe.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/src/vdbe.c) source
file. The [opcode definitions](opcode.html#codes) in this document are derived
from comments in that source file. The
source code comments are the canonical source of information
about the bytecode engine. When in doubt, refer to the source code.


In addition to the primary vdbe.c source code file, there are
other helper code files in the source tree, all of whose names
begin with "vdbe" \- short for "Virtual DataBase Engine".



Remember that the names and meanings of opcodes often change from
one release of SQLite to the next. So if you are studying the [EXPLAIN](lang_explain.html)
output from SQLite, you should reference the version of this document
(or the vdbe.c source code)
that corresponds to the version of SQLite that ran the [EXPLAIN](lang_explain.html).
Otherwise, the description of the opcodes may not be accurate.
