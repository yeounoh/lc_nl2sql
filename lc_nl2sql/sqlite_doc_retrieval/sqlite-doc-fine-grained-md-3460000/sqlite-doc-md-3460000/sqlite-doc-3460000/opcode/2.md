# 2\. Introduction


SQLite works by translating each SQL statement into bytecode and
then running that bytecode.
A [prepared statement](c3ref/stmt.html) in SQLite is mostly just the bytecode needed to
implement the corresponding SQL. The [sqlite3\_prepare\_v2()](c3ref/prepare.html) interface
is a compiler that translates SQL into bytecode.
The [sqlite3\_step()](c3ref/step.html) interface is the virtual machine that runs the
bytecode contained within the [prepared statement](c3ref/stmt.html).



The bytecode virtual machine is the heart of SQLite.
Programmers who want to understand how SQLite operates internally
must be familiar with the bytecode engine.



Historically, the bytecode engine in SQLite is called the
"Virtual DataBase Engine" or "VDBE". This website uses the terms
"bytecode engine", "VDBE", "virtual machine", and "bytecode virtual
machine" interchangeably, as they all mean the same thing.




This article also uses the terms "bytecode program" and
"prepared statement" interchangeably, as they are mostly the same thing.
