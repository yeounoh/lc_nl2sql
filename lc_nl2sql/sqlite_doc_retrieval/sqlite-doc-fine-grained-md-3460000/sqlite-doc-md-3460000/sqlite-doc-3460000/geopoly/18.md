# 4\. Implementation Details


The geopoly module is an extension to the [R\-Tree extension](rtree.html). Geopoly
uses the same underlying logic and shadow tables as the [R\-Tree extension](rtree.html).
Geopoly merely presents a different interface, and provides some extra logic
to compute polygon decoding, overlap, and containment.
