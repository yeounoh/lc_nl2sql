## 4\.2\. Shadow Tables



The geopoly module is built on top of the [R\-Tree extension](rtree.html) and uses the
same underlying shadow tables and algorithms. For indexing purposes, each
polygon is represented in the shadow tables as a rectangular bounding box.
The underlying R\-Tree implementation uses bounding boxes to limit the search
space. Then the geoploy\_overlap() and/or geopoly\_within() routines further
refine the search to the exact answer.
