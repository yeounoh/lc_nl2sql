## 3\.1\. The geopoly\_overlap(P1,P2\) Function



If P1 and P2 are both polygons, then the geopoly\_overlap(P1,P2\) function returns
a non\-zero integer if there is any overlap between P1 and P2, or it returns
zero if P1 and P2 completely disjoint.
If either P1 or P2 is not a polygon, this routine returns NULL.




The geopoly\_overlap(P1,P2\) function is special in that the geopoly virtual
table knows how to use R\*Tree indexes to optimize queries in which the 
WHERE clause uses geopoly\_overlap() as a boolean function. Only the
geopoly\_overlap(P1,P2\) and geopoly\_within(P1,P2\) functions have this
capability.
