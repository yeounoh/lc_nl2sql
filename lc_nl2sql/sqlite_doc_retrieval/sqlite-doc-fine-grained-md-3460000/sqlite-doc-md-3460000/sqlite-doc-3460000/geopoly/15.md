## 3\.9\. The geopoly\_xform(P,A,B,C,D,E,F) Function



The geopoly\_xform(P,A,B,C,D,E,F) function returns a new polygon that is an
affine transformation of the polygon P and where the transformation
is defined by values A,B,C,D,E,F. If P is not a valid polygon, this
routine returns NULL.




The transformation converts each vertex of the polygon according to the
following formula:




```
x1 = A*x0 + B*y0 + E
y1 = C*x0 + D*y0 + F

```


So, for example, to move a polygon by some amount DX, DY without changing
its shape, use:




```
geopoly_xform($polygon, 1, 0, 0, 1, $DX, $DY)

```


To rotate a polygon by R radians around the point 0, 0:




```
geopoly_xform($polygon, cos($R), sin($R), -sin($R), cos($R), 0, 0)

```


Note that a transformation that flips the polygon might cause the
order of vertexes to be reversed. In other words, the transformation
might cause the vertexes to circulate in clockwise order instead of
counter\-clockwise. This can be corrected by sending the result
through the [geopoly\_ccw()](geopoly.html#ccw) function after transformation.
