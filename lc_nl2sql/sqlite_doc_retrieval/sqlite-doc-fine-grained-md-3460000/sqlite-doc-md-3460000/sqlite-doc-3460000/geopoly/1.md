# 1\. Overview



The Geopoly module is an alternative interface to the [R\-Tree extension](rtree.html) that uses
the [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org) notation
([RFC\-7946](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946)) to describe two\-dimensional
polygons. Geopoly includes functions for detecting when one polygon is
contained within or overlaps with another, for computing the
area enclosed by a polygon, for doing linear transformations of polygons,
for rendering polygons as
[SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), and other
similar operations.




The source code for Geopoly is included in the [amalgamation](amalgamation.html). However,
depending on configuration options and the a particular version of SQLite
you are using, the Geopoly extension may or may not be enabled by default.
To ensure that Geopoly is enabled for your build, 
add the [\-DSQLITE\_ENABLE\_GEOPOLY\=1](compile.html#enable_geopoly) compile\-time option.




Geopoly operates on "simple" polygons \- that is, polygons for which
the boundary does not intersect itself. Geopoly thus extends the capabilities
of the [R\-Tree extension](rtree.html) which can only deal with rectangular areas.
On the other hand, the [R\-Tree extension](rtree.html) is
able to handle between 1 and 5 coordinate dimensions, whereas Geopoly is restricted
to 2\-dimensional shapes only.




Each polygon in the Geopoly module can be associated with an arbitrary
number of auxiliary data fields.
