## 3\.6\. The geopoly\_svg(P,...) Function



If P is a polygon, then geopoly\_svg(P,...) returns a text string which is a
[Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)
representation of that polygon. If there is more one argument, then second
and subsequent arguments are added as attributes to each SVG glyph. For example:




```
SELECT geopoly_svg($polygon,'class="poly"','style="fill:blue;"');

```


If P is not a polygon, geopoly\_svg(P,...) returns NULL.




Note that geopoly uses a traditional right\-handed cartesian coordinate system
with the origin at the lower left, whereas SVG uses a left\-handed coordinate
system with the origin at the upper left. The geopoly\_svg() routine makes no
attempt to transform the coordinate system, so the displayed images are shown
in mirror image and rotated. If that is undesirable, the geopoly\_xform() routine
can be used to transform the output from cartesian to SVG coordinates prior to
passing the polygons into geopoly\_svg().
