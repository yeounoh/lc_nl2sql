# 2\. Using The Geopoly Extension



A geopoly table is created as follows:




```
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE newtab USING geopoly(a,b,c);

```


The statement above creates a new geopoly table named "newtab".
Every geopoly table contains a built\-in integer "rowid" column
and a "\_shape" column that contains
the polygon associated with that row of the table.
The example above also defines three auxiliary data columns 
named "a", "b", and "c" that can store whatever additional
information the application needs to associate
with each polygon. If there is no need to store auxiliary
information, the list of auxiliary columns can be omitted.




Store new polygons in the table using ordinary INSERT statements:




```
INSERT INTO newtab(_shape) VALUES('[[0,0],[1,0],[0.5,1],[0,0]]');

```


UPDATE and DELETE statements work similarly.
