## 3\.2\. The geopoly\_within(P1,P2\) Function



If P1 and P2 are both polygons, then the geopoly\_within(P1,P2\) function returns
a non\-zero integer if P1 is completely contained within P2, or it returns zero
if any part of P1 is outside of P2\. If P1 and P2 are the same polygon, this routine
returns non\-zero.
If either P1 or P2 is not a polygon, this routine returns NULL.




The geopoly\_within(P1,P2\) function is special in that the geopoly virtual
table knows how to use R\*Tree indexes to optimize queries in which the 
WHERE clause uses geopoly\_within() as a boolean function. Only the
geopoly\_within(P1,P2\) and geopoly\_overlap(P1,P2\) functions have this
capability.
