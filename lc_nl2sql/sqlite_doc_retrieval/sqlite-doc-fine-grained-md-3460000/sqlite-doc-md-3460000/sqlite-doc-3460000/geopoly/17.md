## 3\.11\. The geopoly\_ccw(J) Function


The geopoly\_ccw(J) function returns the polygon J with counter\-clockwise (CCW) rotation.




[RFC\-7946](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946) requires that polygons use CCW rotation.
But the spec also observes that many legacy GeoJSON files do not following the spec and
contain polygons with clockwise (CW) rotation. The geopoly\_ccw() function is useful for
applications that are reading legacy GeoJSON scripts. If the input to geopoly\_ccw() is
a correctly\-formatted polygon, then no changes are made. However, if the circulation of
the input polygon is backwards, then geopoly\_ccw() reverses the circulation order so that
it conforms to the spec and so that it will work correctly with the Geopoly module.
