## 1\.1\. GeoJSON


The [GeoJSON standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946) is syntax for
exchanging geospatial information using JSON. GeoJSON is a rich standard
that can describe nearly any kind of geospatial content.



The Geopoly module only understands
a small subset of GeoJSON, but a critical subset. 
In particular, GeoJSON understands
the JSON array of vertexes that describes a simple polygon.



A polygon is defined by its vertexes.
Each vertex is a JSON array of two numeric values which are the
X and Y coordinates of the vertex.
A polygon is a JSON array of at least four of these vertexes, 
and hence is an array of arrays.
The first and last vertex in the array must be the same.
The polygon follows the right\-hand rule: When tracing a line from
one vertex to the next, the area to the right of the line is outside
of the polygon and the area to the left is inside the polygon.
In other words, the net rotation of the vertexes is counter\-clockwise.




For example, the following JSON describes an isosceles triangle, sitting
on the X axis and with an area of 0\.5:




```
[[0,0],[1,0],[0.5,1],[0,0]]

```


A triangle has three vertexes, but the GeoJSON description of the triangle
has 4 vertexes because the first and last vertex are duplicates.
