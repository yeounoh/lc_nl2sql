## 3\.1\. Source Code Files


If you want to build the recovery API into your application, you will
need to add some source files to your build, above and beyond the usual
"sqlite3\.c" and "sqlite3\.h" source files. You will need:







> | [sqlite3recover.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/recover/sqlite3recover.c) | This is the main source file that implements the recovery API. |
> | --- | --- |
> | [sqlite3recover.h](https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/recover/sqlite3recover.h) | This is the header file that goes with sqlite3recover.h. |
> | [dbdata.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/recover/dbdata.c) | This file implements two virtual tables name "sqlite\_dbdata" and "sqlite\_dbptr" that required by sqlite3recover.c. |



The two C source file above need to be linked into your application in the
same way as "sqlite3\.c" is linked in. And the header file needs to be
accessible to the compiler when the C files are being compiled.




Additionally, the application, or more specifically the sqlite3\.c linked
into the application, must be compiled with the following option:



```

        -DSQLITE_ENABLE_DBPAGE_VTAB

```
