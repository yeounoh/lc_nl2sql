# 1\. Recovering (Some) Data From A Corrupt SQLite Database



SQLite databases are remarkably rebust. Application faults and
power failures typically leave the content of the database intact.
However, it is possible to [corrupt an SQLite database](howtocorrupt.html).
For example, hardware malfunctions can damage the database file, or a
rogue process can open the database and overwrite parts of it.




Given a corrupt database file, it is sometimes desirable to try to
salvage as much data from the file as possible. The recovery API
is designed to facilitate this.
