### 2007\-11\-05 \- Version 3\.5\.2


> This is an incremental release that fixes several minor problems,
>  adds some obscure features, and provides some performance tweaks.
>  Upgrading is optional.
>  The experimental compile\-time option
>  [SQLITE\_OMIT\_MEMORY\_ALLOCATION](compile.html#omitfeatures) is no longer supported. On the other
>  hand, it is now possible to compile SQLite so that it uses a static
>  array for all its dynamic memory allocation needs and never calls
>  malloc. Expect to see additional radical changes to the memory
>  allocation subsystem in future releases.
