### 2007\-11\-27 \- Version 3\.5\.3


> This is an incremental release that fixes several minor problems.
>  Upgrading is optional. If Version 3\.5\.2 or 3\.5\.1 is working fine
>  for you, then there is no pressing need to change to 3\.5\.3\.
>  The prebuilt binaries and the amalgamation found on the
>  [download](download.html) page include the FTS3 fulltext
>  search extension module. We are doing this on an experimental
>  basis and are not promising to provide prebuilt binaries with
>  FTS3 in the future.
