### 2009\-12\-07 \- Version 3\.6\.21


> SQLite [version 3\.6\.21](releaselog/3_6_21.html) focuses on performance optimization. For
>  a certain set of traces, this version uses 12% fewer CPU instructions
>  than the previous release (as measured by Valgrind). In addition, the
>  [FTS3](fts3.html) extension has been through an extensive cleanup and rework and
>  the [sqlite3\_trace()](c3ref/profile.html) interface has been modified to insert
>  [bound parameter](lang_expr.html#varparam) values into its output.
