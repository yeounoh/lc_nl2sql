### 2014\-03\-11 \- Release 3\.8\.4\.1


> SQLite [version 3\.8\.4\.1](releaselog/3_8_4_1.html) is a patch against [version 3\.8\.4](releaselog/3_8_4.html) that fixes
>  two minor issues:
> 1. Work around a C\-preprocessor macro conflict that causes compilation
>  problems for some configurations of Visual Studio.
> - Adjust the cost computation for the [skip\-scan optimization](optoverview.html#skipscan) for
>  improved performance.
> 
> 
> Both of these issues came to light within minutes of tagging the previous
> release. Neither issue is serious but they can be annoying. Hence, the
> decision was made to do a quick patch release to address both issues.
