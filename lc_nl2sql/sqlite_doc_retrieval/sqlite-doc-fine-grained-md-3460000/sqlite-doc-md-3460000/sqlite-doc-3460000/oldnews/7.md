### 2015\-05\-09 \- Release 3\.8\.10\.1


> The 3\.8\.10 release did not add the new [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_DBSTAT\_VTAB](compile.html#enable_dbstat_vtab)
>  compile\-time option to the [sqlite3\_compileoption\_used()](c3ref/compileoption_get.html) interface.
>  This patch release fixes that omission. And while we are at it,
>  the associated [dbstat virtual table](dbstat.html) was enhanced slightly and a
>  harmless compiler warning was fixed.
> 
> 
>  There is no reason to upgrade from version 3\.8\.10 unless you are
>  using the new [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_DBSTAT\_VTAB](compile.html#enable_dbstat_vtab) compile\-time option.
