> SQLite [version 3\.7\.12\.1](releaselog/3_7_12_1.html) is a patch release for [version 3\.7\.12](releaselog/3_7_12.html) that
>  fixes a [bug](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/c2ad16f997ee9c) that was
>  introduced in version 3\.7\.12 and that can
>  cause a segfault for certain obscure nested aggregate queries.
>  There are very few changes in 3\.7\.12\.1, and upgrading is only needed for
>  applications that do nested aggregate queries.
