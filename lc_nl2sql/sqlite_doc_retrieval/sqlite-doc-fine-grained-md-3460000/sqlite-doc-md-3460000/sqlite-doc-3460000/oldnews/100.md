### 2007\-04\-25 \- Version 3\.3\.17


> This version fixes a bug in the forwards\-compatibility logic of SQLite
>  that was causing a database to become unreadable when it should have
>  been read\-only. Upgrade from 3\.3\.16 only if you plan to deploy into
>  a product that might need to be upgraded in the future. For day to day
>  use, it probably does not matter.
