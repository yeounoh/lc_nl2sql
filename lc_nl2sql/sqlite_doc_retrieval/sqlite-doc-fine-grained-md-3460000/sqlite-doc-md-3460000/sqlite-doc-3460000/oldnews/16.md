### 2014\-11\-19 \- Release 3\.8\.7\.2


> SQLite [version 3\.8\.7\.2](releaselog/3_8_7_2.html) is a patch and bug\-fix release. Changes from
>  the previous release are minimal.
> 
> 
> The primary reason for this release is to enhance the [ROLLBACK](lang_transaction.html) command
>  so that it allows running queries on the same database connection to
>  continue running as long as the ROLLBACK does not change the schema.
>  In all previous versions of SQLite, a ROLLBACK would cause pending
>  queries to stop immediately and return [SQLITE\_ABORT](rescode.html#abort) or
>  [SQLITE\_ABORT\_ROLLBACK](rescode.html#abort_rollback). Pending queries still abort if the ROLLBACK
>  changes the database schema, but as of this patch release, the queries
>  are allowed to continue running if the schema is unmodified.
> 
> 
> In addition to the ROLLBACK enhancement, this patch release also
>  includes fixes for three obscure bugs. See the
>  [change log](releaselog/3_8_7_2.html) for details.
