### 2005\-09\-16 \- Version 3\.2\.6 \- Critical Bug Fix


> This version fixes a bug that can result in database
>  corruption if a VACUUM of a 1 gigabyte or larger database fails
>  (perhaps do to running out of disk space or an unexpected power loss)
>  and is later rolled back.
>  
>  Also in this release:
>  The ORDER BY and GROUP BY processing was rewritten to use less memory.
>  Support for COUNT(DISTINCT) was added. The LIKE operator can now be
>  used by the optimizer on columns with COLLATE NOCASE.
