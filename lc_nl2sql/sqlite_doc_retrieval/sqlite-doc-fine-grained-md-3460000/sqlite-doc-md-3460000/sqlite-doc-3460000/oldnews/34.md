### 2013\-03\-29 \- Release 3\.7\.16\.1


> SQLite [version 3\.7\.16\.1](releaselog/3_7_16_1.html) is a bug fix release that fixes a few problems
>  that were present in the previous releases.
>  The primary motivation for version 3\.7\.16\.1 is to fix a bug in the
>  query optimizer that was introduced as part of [version 3\.7\.15](releaselog/3_7_15.html). The
>  query optimizer was being a little overzealous in optimizing out some
>  ORDER BY clauses, which resulted in sorting being omitted on occasions
>  where sorting is required to get the correct answer. See
>  ticket [a179fe7465](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/a179fe7465) for
>  details.
> 
> 
>  In addition to the ORDER BY fix, several other patches to fix obscure
>  (and mostly harmless) bugs and to fix spelling errors in source code
>  comments are also included in this release.
