### 2007\-09\-04 \- Version 3\.5\.0 alpha


> The OS interface layer and the memory allocation subsystems in
>  SQLite have been reimplemented. The published API is largely unchanged
>  but the (unpublished) OS interface has been modified extensively.
>  Applications that implement their own OS interface will require
>  modification. See
>  [34to35\.html](34to35.html) for details.
>  This is a large change. Approximately 10% of the source code was
>  modified. We are calling this first release "alpha" in order to give
>  the user community time to test and evaluate the changes before we
>  freeze the new design.
