### 2014\-12\-06 \- Release 3\.8\.7\.3


> SQLite [version 3\.8\.7\.3](releaselog/3_8_7_3.html) an unscheduled bug\-fix release. Changes from
>  the previous release and from [version 3\.8\.7](releaselog/3_8_7.html) are minimal.
> 
> 
> This release fixes two obscure bugs that can result in incorrect
>  query results and/or application crashes, but not (as far as we can
>  tell) security vulnerabilities. Both bugs have been latent in the
>  code across multiple prior releases and have never before been encountered,
>  so they are unlikely to cause problems. Nevertheless
>  it seems prudent to publish fixes for them both. See the
>  change log for details.
