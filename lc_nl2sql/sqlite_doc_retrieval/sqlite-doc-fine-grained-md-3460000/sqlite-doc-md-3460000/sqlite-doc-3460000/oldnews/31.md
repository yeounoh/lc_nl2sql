### 2013\-08\-26 \- Release 3\.8\.0


> **Do not fear the zero!**
>  SQLite [version 3\.8\.0](releaselog/3_8_0.html) might easily have been called "3\.7\.18" instead.
>  However, this release features the cutover of the
>  [next generation query planner](queryplanner-ng.html) or [NGQP](queryplanner-ng.html), and there is a small chance of
>  [breaking legacy programs](queryplanner-ng.html#hazards) that
>  rely on undefined behavior in previous SQLite releases, and so the
>  minor version number was incremented for that reason.
>  But the risks are low and there is a [query planner checklist](queryplanner-ng.html#howtofix) is
>  available to application developers to aid in avoiding problems.
> 
> 
>  SQLite [version 3\.8\.0](releaselog/3_8_0.html) is actually one of the most heavily tested
>  SQLite releases ever. Thousands and thousands of beta copies have
>  be downloaded, and presumably tested, and there have been no problem
>  reports.
> 
> 
>  In addition to the [next generation query planner](queryplanner-ng.html), the 3\.8\.0 release
>  adds support for [partial indices](partialindex.html), as well as several other new features.
>  See the [change log](releaselog/3_8_0.html) for further detail.
