### 2007\-06\-18 \- Version 3\.4\.0


> This release fixes two separate bugs either of which
>  can lead to database corruption. Upgrading
>  is strongly recommended. If you must continue using an older version
>  of SQLite, please at least read about how to avoid these bugs
>  at CorruptionFollowingBusyError and ticket \#2418
>  
>  This release also adds explicit [limits](limits.html) on the
>  sizes and quantities of things SQLite will handle. The new limits might
>  causes compatibility problems for existing applications that
>  use excessively large strings, BLOBs, tables, or SQL statements.
>  The new limits can be increased at compile\-time to work around any problems
>  that arise. Nevertheless, the version number of this release is
>  3\.4\.0 instead of 3\.3\.18 in order to call attention to the possible
>  incompatibility.
>  
> 
> 
>  There are also new features, including
>  [incremental BLOB I/O](c3ref/blob_open.html) and
>  [incremental vacuum](pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum).
>  See the [change log](changes.html#version_3_4_0)
>  for additional information.
