### 2006\-01\-10 \- Version 3\.3\.0 alpha


> Version 3\.3\.0 adds support for CHECK constraints, DESC indices,
>  separate REAL and INTEGER column affinities, a new OS interface layer
>  design, and many other changes. The code passed a regression
>  test but should still be considered alpha. Please report any
>  problems.
>  The file format for version 3\.3\.0 has changed slightly to support
>  descending indices and
>  a more efficient encoding of boolean values. SQLite 3\.3\.0 will read and
>  write legacy databases created with any prior version of SQLite 3\. But
>  databases created by version 3\.3\.0 will not be readable or writable
>  by earlier versions of the SQLite. The older file format can be
>  specified at compile\-time for those rare cases where it is needed.
