### 2013\-03\-18 \- Release 3\.7\.16


> SQLite [version 3\.7\.16](releaselog/3_7_16.html) is a regularly scheduled release of SQLite.
>  This release contains several language enhancements and improvements
>  to the query optimizer. A list of the major enhancements and optimizations
>  can be see on the [change log](releaselog/3_7_16.html).
>  There was one important bug fix
>  (see [Ticket fc7bd6358f](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/fc7bd6358f))
>  that addresses an incorrect query result that could have occurred in
>  a three\-way join where the join constraints compared INTEGER columns
>  to TEXT columns. This issue had been in the code for time out of mind
>  and had never before been reported, so we surmise that it is very obscure.
>  Nevertheless, all users are advised to upgrade to avoid any future problems
>  associated with this issue.
