### 2008\-11\-26 \- Version 3\.6\.6\.2


> This release fixes a bug that was introduced into SQLite [version 3\.6\.6](releaselog/3_6_6.html)
>  and which seems like it might be able to cause database corruption. This
>  bug was detected during stress testing. It has not been seen in the wild.
>  An analysis of the problem suggests that the bug might be able to cause
>  database corruption, however focused efforts to find a real\-world test
>  cases that actually causes database corruption have so far been unsuccessful.
>  Hence, the likelihood of this bug causing problems is low. Nevertheless,
>  we have decided to do an emergency branch release out of an abundance of
>  caution.
>  The [version 3\.6\.6\.2](releaselog/3_6_6_2.html) release also fixes an obscure memory leak that
>  can occur following a disk I/O error.
