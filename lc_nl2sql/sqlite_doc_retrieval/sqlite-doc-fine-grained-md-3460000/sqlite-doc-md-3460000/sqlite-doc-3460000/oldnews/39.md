### 2012\-10\-04 \- Release 3\.7\.14\.1


> SQLite [version 3\.7\.14\.1](releaselog/3_7_14_1.html) is a patch release. Changes from the baseline
>  version 3\.7\.14 are minimal and are restricted to fixing three bugs.
>  One of the fixed bugs is a long\-standing issue with the TCL interface.
>  Another is an external compiler bug that SQLite merely works around and
>  that only comes up if you are using the VisualStudio\-2012 compiler to
>  generate WinRT applications on ARM with optimizations enabled. The
>  third problem is an SQLite core bug, introduced in version 3\.7\.14, that
>  can cause a segfault if a query contains a LEFT JOIN that contains an OR
>  in the ON clause.
