### 2010\-07\-22 \- Version 3\.7\.0


> SQLite [version 3\.7\.0](releaselog/3_7_0.html) is a major release of SQLite that features
>  a new transaction control mechanism using a [write\-ahead log](wal.html) or [WAL](wal.html).
>  The traditional rollback\-journal is still used as the default so there
>  should be no visible change for legacy programs. But newer programs
>  can take advantage of improved performance and concurrency by enabling
>  the WAL journaling mode.
>  SQLite version 3\.7\.0 also contains some query planner enhancements and
>  a few obscure bug fixes, but the only really big change is the addition
>  of WAL mode.
