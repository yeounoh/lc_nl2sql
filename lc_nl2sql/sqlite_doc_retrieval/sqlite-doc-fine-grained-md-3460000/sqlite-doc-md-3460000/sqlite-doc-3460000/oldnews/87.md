### 2008\-04\-16 \- Version 3\.5\.8


> Version 3\.5\.8 includes some important new performance optimizations
>  in the virtual machine code generator, including constant subexpression
>  factoring and common subexpression elimination. This release also
>  creates new public interfaces:
>  [sqlite3\_randomness()](c3ref/randomness.html) provides access to SQLite's internal
>  pseudo\-random number generator, [sqlite3\_limit()](c3ref/limit.html) allows size
>  limits to be set at run\-time on a per\-connection basis, and
>  [sqlite3\_context\_db\_handle()](c3ref/context_db_handle.html) is a convenience routine that allows
>  an application\-defined SQL function implementation to retrieve
>  its [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html) handle.
>  This release of SQLite is considered stable and ready for production use.
