### 2006\-01\-16 \- Version 3\.3\.1 alpha


> Many bugs found in last week's alpha release have now been fixed and
>  the library is running much faster again.
>  Database connections can now be moved between threads as long as the
>  connection holds no locks at the time it is moved. Thus the common
>  paradigm of maintaining a pool of database connections and handing
>  them off to transient worker threads is now supported.
>  Please help test this new feature.
>  See the MultiThreading wiki page for additional
>  information.
