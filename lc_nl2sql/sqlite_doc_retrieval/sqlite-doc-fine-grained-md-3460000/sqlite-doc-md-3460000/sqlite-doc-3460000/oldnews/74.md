### 2009\-05\-07 \- Version 3\.6\.14


> SQLite [version 3\.6\.14](releaselog/3_6_14.html) provides new performance enhancements in
>  the btree and pager layers and in the query optimizer. Certain
>  workloads can be as much as twice as fast as the previous release,
>  though 10% faster is a more typical result.
>  Queries against [virtual tables](vtab.html) that contain OR and IN operators
>  in the WHERE clause are now able to use indexing.
> 
> 
>  A new optional [asynchronous I/O backend](asyncvfs.html) is available for
>  Unix and Windows. The asynchronous backend gives the illusion of faster
>  response time by pushing slow write operations into a background thread.
>  The tradeoff for faster response time is that more memory is required
>  (to hold the content of the pending writes) and if a power failure or
>  program crash occurs, some transactions that appeared to have committed
>  might end up being rolled back upon restart.
> 
> 
>  This release also contains many minor bug fixes, documentation enhancements,
>  new test cases, and cleanups and simplifications to the source code.
> 
> 
>  There is no compelling reason to upgrade from versions 3\.6\.12 or
>  3\.6\.13 if those prior versions are working. Though many users may
>  benefit from the improved performance.
