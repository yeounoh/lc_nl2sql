### 2005\-02\-15 \- Versions 2\.8\.16 and 3\.1\.2 Released


> A critical bug in the VACUUM command that can lead to database
>  corruption has been fixed in both the 2\.x branch and the main
>  3\.x line. This bug has existed in all prior versions of SQLite.
>  Even though it is unlikely you will ever encounter this bug,
>  it is suggested that all users upgrade. See
>  ticket \#1116 for additional information.
>  Version 3\.1\.2 is also the first stable release of the 3\.1
>  series. SQLite 3\.1 features added support for correlated
>  subqueries, autovacuum, autoincrement, ALTER TABLE, and
>  other enhancements. See the
>  [release notes
>  for version 3\.1\.0](releaselog/3_1_0.html) for a detailed description of the
>  changes available in the 3\.1 series.
