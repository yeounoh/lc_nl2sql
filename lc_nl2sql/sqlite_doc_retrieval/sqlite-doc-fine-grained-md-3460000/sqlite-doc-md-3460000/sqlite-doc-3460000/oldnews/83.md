### 2008\-08\-30 \- Version 3\.6\.2


> SQLite version 3\.6\.2 contains rewrites of the page\-cache subsystem and
>  the procedures for matching identifiers to table columns in SQL statements.
>  These changes are designed to better modularize the code and make it more
>  maintainable and reliable moving forward. Nearly 5000 non\-comment lines
>  of core code (about 11\.3%) have changed
>  from the previous release. Nevertheless, there should be no
>  application\-visible changes, other than bug fixes.
