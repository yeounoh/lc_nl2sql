### 2010\-01\-06 \- Version 3\.6\.22


> SQLite [version 3\.6\.22](releaselog/3_6_22.html) is a bug\-fix release. Two bugs have been fixed
>  that might cause incorrect query results.
>  * Ticket [31338dca7e](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/31338dca7e)
>  describes a
>  problem with queries that have a WHERE clause of the form (x AND y) OR z
>  where x and z come from one table of a join and y comes from a different
>  table.
>  * Ticket [eb5548a849](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/eb5548a849)
>  describes
>  a problem where the use of the CAST operator in the WHERE clause can lead
>  to incorrect results if the column being cast to a new datatype is also
>  used in the same WHERE clause without being cast.
> 
> 
>  Both bugs are obscure,
>  but because they could arise in an application after deployment, it is
>  recommended that all applications upgrade SQLite to version 3\.6\.22\.
>  This release also includes other minor bug fixes and performance
>  enhancements, especially in the [FTS3](fts3.html) extension.
