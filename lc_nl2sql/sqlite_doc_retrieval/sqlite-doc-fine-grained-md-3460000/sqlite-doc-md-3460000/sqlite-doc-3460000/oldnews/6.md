### 2015\-05\-20 \- Release 3\.8\.10\.2


> Yikes! Index corruption after a sequence of valid SQL statements!
> It has been many years since anything like
>  [this bug](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/34cd55d6) has snuck into
>  an official SQLite release. But for the pasts seven months
>  ([version 3\.8\.7](releaselog/3_8_7.html) through [version 3\.8\.10\.1](releaselog/3_8_10_1.html))
>  if you do an INSERT into a carefully
>  crafted schema in which there are two nested triggers that convert
>  an index key value from TEXT to INTEGER and then back
>  to TEXT again, the INTEGER value might get inserted as the index
>  key instead of the correct TEXT, resulting in index corruption.
>  This patch release adds a single line of code to fix the problem.
> If you do actually encounter this problem, running [REINDEX](lang_reindex.html) on the
>  damaged indexes will clear it.
