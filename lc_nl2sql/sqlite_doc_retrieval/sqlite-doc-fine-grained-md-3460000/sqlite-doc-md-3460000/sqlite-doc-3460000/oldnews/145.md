### 2004\-06\-25 \- Website hacked


> The www.sqlite.org website was hacked sometime around 2004\-06\-22
>  because the lead SQLite developer failed to properly patch CVS.
>  Evidence suggests that the attacker was unable to elevate privileges
>  above user "cvs". Nevertheless, as a precaution the entire website
>  has been reconstructed from scratch on a fresh machine. All services
>  should be back to normal as of 2004\-06\-28\.
