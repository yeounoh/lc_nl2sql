### 2013\-04\-12 \- Release 3\.7\.16\.2


> SQLite [version 3\.7\.16\.2](releaselog/3_7_16_2.html) fixes a long\-standing flaw in the Windows
>  OS interface that
>  can result in database corruption under a rare race condition.
>  See <https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7ff3120e4f> for a full description
>  of the problem.
>  As far as we know, this bug has never been seen in the wild. The
>  problem was discovered by the SQLite developers while writing stress tests
>  for a separate component of SQLite. Those stress tests have not yet
>  found any problems with the component they were intended to verify, but
>  they did find the bug which is the subject of this patch release.
> 
> 
>  Other than updates to version numbers, the only difference between this
>  release and 3\.7\.16\.1 is a two\-character change in a single identifier,
>  which is contained in the windows\-specific OS interface logic. There
>  are no changes in this release (other than version numbers) for platforms
>  other than Windows.
