### 2015\-02\-25 \- Release 3\.8\.8\.3


> The 3\.8\.8\.3 patch release fixes an obscure problem in the SQLite code
>  generator that can cause incorrect results when the qualifying expression
>  of a [partial index](partialindex.html) is used inside the ON clause of a LEFT JOIN.
>  This problem has been in the code since support for partial indexes
>  was first added in version 3\.8\.0\. However, it is difficult to imagine
>  a valid reason to every put the qualifying constraint inside the ON
>  clause of a LEFT JOIN, and so this issue has never come up before.
> 
> 
> Any applications that is vulnerable to this bug would have encountered
>  problems already. Hence, upgrading from the previous release is optional.
