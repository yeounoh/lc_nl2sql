### 2014\-02\-03 \- Release 3\.8\.3


> SQLite [version 3\.8\.3](releaselog/3_8_3.html) is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
>  Upgrading from the previous release is optional.
> 
> 
>  The most visible change in version 3\.8\.3 is the addition of
>  support for [common table expressions](lang_with.html). It is now possible to write a
>  single [SELECT](lang_select.html) statement that will query a tree or graph, using either
>  a depth\-first or a breadth\-first search. A single SQLite query will
>  even [solve Sudoku puzzles](lang_with.html#sudoku) or [compute the Mandelbrot set](lang_with.html#mandelbrot). As part
>  of this change, SQLite now accepts a [VALUES clause](lang_select.html#values) anyplace that
>  a [SELECT](lang_select.html) statement is valid.
> 
> 
>  This release also includes many small performance enhancements which
>  should give a small speed boost to legacy applications. And there are
>  other minor enhancements such as the addition of the [printf()](lang_corefunc.html#printf) SQL
>  function. See the [change log](releaselog/3_8_3.html) for details.
