### 2005\-12\-19 \- Versions 3\.2\.8 and 2\.8\.17


> These versions contain one\-line changes to 3\.2\.7 and 2\.8\.16 to fix a bug
>  that has been present since March of 2002 and version 2\.4\.0\.
>  That bug might possibly cause database corruption if a large INSERT or
>  UPDATE statement within a multi\-statement transaction fails due to a
>  uniqueness constraint but the containing transaction commits.
