### 2009\-07\-25 \- 100% Branch Test Coverage


> A subset of the [TH3](th3.html) test suite was measured by gcov to provide
>  [100% branch test coverage](testing.html#coverage) over the SQLite core
>  (exclusive of the VFS backend and of extensions such as FTS3 and RTREE)
>  when compiled for SuSE 10\.1 Linux on x86\. The SQLite developers pledge
>  to maintain branch test coverage at 100% in all future releases.
>  Ongoing work will strive for 100% branch test coverage on the
>  operating\-system backends and extensions as well.
