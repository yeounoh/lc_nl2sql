### 2012\-03\-20 \- Version 3\.7\.11


> SQLite [version 3\.7\.11](releaselog/3_7_11.html) is a regularly scheduled maintenance release
>  which was rushed out early due to a
>  [bug in the query optimizer](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/b7c8682cc1)
>  introduced in the previous release. The bug is obscure \- it changes
>  a LEFT JOIN into an INNER JOIN in some cases when there is a 3\-way join
>  and OR terms in the WHERE clause. But it was considered serious enough to
>  rush out a fix. Apart from this one problem, SQLite [version 3\.7\.10](releaselog/3_7_10.html) has
>  not given any trouble. Upgrading to [version 3\.7\.11](releaselog/3_7_11.html) from versions
>  3\.7\.6\.3, 3\.7\.7, 3\.7\.7\.1, 3\.7\.8, or 3\.7\.9 is
>  optional. Upgrading from other releases, including the previous release
>  3\.7\.10, is recommended.
>  Other enhancements found in this release are enumerated in the
>  [change log](releaselog/3_7_11.html).
