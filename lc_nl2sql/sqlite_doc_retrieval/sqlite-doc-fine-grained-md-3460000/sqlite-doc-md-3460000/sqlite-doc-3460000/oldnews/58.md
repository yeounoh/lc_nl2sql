### 2010\-August\-23 \- Version 3\.7\.1


> SQLite [version 3\.7\.1](releaselog/3_7_1.html) is a stabilization release for the 3\.7\.x series.
>  Other than the filesize\-in\-header bug that was fixed in [version 3\.7\.0\.1](releaselog/3_7_0_1.html),
>  no major problems have been seen in 3\.7\.0\. Some minor corner\-case
>  performance regressions have been fixed. A typo in the OS/2 interface
>  has been repaired.
>  A biggest part of the 3\.7\.1 release is a cleanup and refactoring of
>  the pager module within SQLite. This refactoring should have no
>  application\-visible effects. The purpose was to reorganize the code
>  in ways that make it easier to prove correctness.
> 
> 
>  The 3\.7\.1 release adds new experimental methods for obtained more
>  detailed memory usage information and for controlling database file
>  fragmentation. And the query planner now does a better job of
>  optimizing the [LIKE](lang_expr.html#like) and [GLOB](lang_expr.html#glob) operators.
> 
> 
>  This release increases the maximum size of database pages from 32KiB to
>  64KiB. A database with 64KiB pages will not be readable or writable by
>  older versions of SQLite. Note that further increases in page size
>  are not feasible since the [file format](fileformat2.html) uses 16\-bit offsets to structures
>  within each page.
