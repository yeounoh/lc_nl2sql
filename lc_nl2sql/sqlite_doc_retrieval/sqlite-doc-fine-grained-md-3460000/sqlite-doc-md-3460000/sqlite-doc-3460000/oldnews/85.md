### 2008\-07\-16 \- Version 3\.6\.0 beta


> Version 3\.6\.0 makes changes to the [VFS](c3ref/vfs.html) object in order
>  to make SQLite more easily portable to a wider variety of platforms.
>  There are potential incompatibilities with some legacy applications.
>  See the [35to36\.html](35to36.html) document for details.
>  Many new interfaces are introduced in version 3\.6\.0\. The code is
>  very well tested and is appropriate for use in stable systems. We
>  have attached the "beta" designation only so that we can make tweaks to
>  the new interfaces in the next release without having to declare an
>  incompatibility.
