### 2014\-08\-15 \- Release 3\.8\.6


> SQLite [version 3\.8\.6](releaselog/3_8_6.html) is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
>  Upgrading from all previous versions is recommended.
> 
> 
> This release contains the usual assortment of obscure bug fixes.
>  One bug, however, deserves special attention.
>  A problem appeared in the [CREATE INDEX](lang_createindex.html) command beginning with
>  [version 3\.8\.2](releaselog/3_8_2.html) (2013\-12\-06\) that allowed, under some circumstances,
>  a UNIQUE index to be created on a column that was not unique. Once
>  the index was created, no new non\-unique entries could be inserted, but
>  preexisting non\-unique entries would remain. See ticket
>  [9a6daf340df99ba93c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/9a6daf340df99ba93c)
>  for further information. In addition to fixing this bug, the
>  [PRAGMA integrity\_check](pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check) command has been enhanced to detect
>  non\-uniqueness in UNIQUE indices, so that if this bug did introduce
>  any problems in databases, those problems can be easily detected.
> 
> 
> Other noteworthy changes include the addition of support for
>  [hexadecimal integers](lang_expr.html#hexint) (ex: 0x1234\), and performance enhancements
>  to the [IN operator](lang_expr.html#in_op) which, according to
>  [mailing list reports](http://www.mail-archive.com/sqlite-users%40sqlite.org/msg85350.html),
>  help some queries run up to five times faster.
> 
> 
> Version 3\.8\.6 uses 25% fewer CPU cycles than version 3\.8\.0 from
>  approximately one year ago, according to [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/)
>  and the
>  [test/speedtest1\.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/artifact/d29c8048beb7e)
>  test program.
>  On the other hand,
>  the compiled binary for version 3\.8\.6 is about 5% larger than 3\.8\.0\.
>  The size increase is
>  due in part to the addition of new features such as [WITHOUT ROWID](withoutrowid.html)
>  tables and [common table expressions](lang_with.html).
