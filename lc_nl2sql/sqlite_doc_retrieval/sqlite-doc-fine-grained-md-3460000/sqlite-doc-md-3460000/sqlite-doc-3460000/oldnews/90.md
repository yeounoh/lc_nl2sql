### 2008\-01\-31 \- Version 3\.5\.5


> Version 3\.5\.5 changes over 8% of the core source code of SQLite in order
>  to convert the internal virtual machine from a stack\-based design into
>  a register\-based design. This change will allow future optimizations
>  and will avoid an entire class of stack overflow bugs that have caused
>  problems in the past. Even though this change is large, extensive testing
>  has found zero errors in the new virtual machine and so we believe this
>  to be a very stable release.
