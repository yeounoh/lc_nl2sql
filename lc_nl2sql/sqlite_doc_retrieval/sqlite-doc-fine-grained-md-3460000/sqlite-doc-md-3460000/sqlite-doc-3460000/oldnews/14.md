### 2014\-12\-09 \- Release 3\.8\.7\.4


> SQLite [version 3\.8\.7\.4](releaselog/3_8_7_4.html) an unscheduled bug\-fix release. Changes from
>  the previous release and from [version 3\.8\.7](releaselog/3_8_7.html) are minimal.
> 
> 
> This release fixes adds in a mutex that is required by the changes of
>  the 3\.8\.7\.3 patch but was accidentally omitted. The mutex was not required
>  by any of the internal SQLite tests, but Firefox crashes without it.
>  Test cases have been added to ensure that mutex is never again missed.
