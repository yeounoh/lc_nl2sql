### 2008\-11\-22 \- Version 3\.6\.6\.1


> This release fixes a bug that was introduced into SQLite [version 3\.6\.4](releaselog/3_6_4.html)
>  and that can cause database corruption in obscure cases. This bug has
>  never been seen in the wild; it was first detected by internal stress
>  tests and required substantial analysis before it could be shown to
>  potentially lead to corruption. So we feel that SQLite versions 3\.6\.4,
>  3\.6\.5, and 3\.6\.6 are safe to use for development work. But upgrading
>  to this patch release or later is recommended prior to deploying
>  products that incorporate SQLite.
>  We have taken the unusual step of issuing a patch release in order to
>  get the fix for this bug into circulation quickly. SQLite version 3\.6\.7
>  will continue on its normal path of development with an anticipated
>  release in mid December.
