### 2012\-12\-19 \- Release 3\.7\.15\.1


> SQLite [version 3\.7\.15\.1](releaselog/3_7_15_1.html) is a patch release that fixes a single bug
>  that was introduced in version [version 3\.7\.15](releaselog/3_7_15.html). The fix involved changing
>  two lines of code and adding a single assert(). This release also includes
>  some new test cases to prevent a regression of the bug, and the version
>  number is increased, of course. But otherwise, nothing has changed from
>  [version 3\.7\.15](releaselog/3_7_15.html).
