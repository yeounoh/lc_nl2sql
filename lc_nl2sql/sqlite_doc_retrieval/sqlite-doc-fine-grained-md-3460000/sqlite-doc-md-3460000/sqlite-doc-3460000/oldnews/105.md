### 2007\-01\-27 \- Version 3\.3\.12


> The first published build of the previous version used the wrong
>  set of source files. Consequently, many people downloaded a build
>  that was labeled as "3\.3\.11" but was really 3\.3\.10\. Version 3\.3\.12
>  is released to clear up the ambiguity. A couple more bugs have
>  also been fixed and [PRAGMA integrity\_check](pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check) has been enhanced.
