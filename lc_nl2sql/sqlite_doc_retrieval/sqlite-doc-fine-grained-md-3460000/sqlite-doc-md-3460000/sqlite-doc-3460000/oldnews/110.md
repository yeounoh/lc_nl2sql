### 2006\-08\-12 \- Version 3\.3\.7


> Version 3\.3\.7 includes support for loadable extensions and virtual
>  tables. But both features are still considered "beta" and their
>  APIs are subject to change in a future release. This release is
>  mostly to make available the minor bug fixes that have accumulated
>  since 3\.3\.6\. Upgrading is not necessary. Do so only if you encounter
>  one of the obscure bugs that have been fixed or if you want to try
>  out the new features.
