### 2013\-05\-20 \- Release 3\.7\.17


> SQLite [version 3\.7\.17](releaselog/3_7_17.html) is a regularly schedule maintenance release.
>  Visit the [change log](releaselog/3_7_17.html) for a full explanation of the
>  changes in this release.
>  There are many bug fixes in version 3\.7\.17\. But this does not indicate
>  that 3\.7\.16 was a problematic release. All of the bugs in 3\.7\.17 are
>  obscure and are unlikely to impact any particular application. And most
>  of the bugs that are fixed in 3\.7\.17 predate 3\.7\.16 and have been in
>  the code for years without ever before being noticed.
>  Nevertheless, due to the large number of fixes,
>  all users are encouraged to upgrade when possible.
