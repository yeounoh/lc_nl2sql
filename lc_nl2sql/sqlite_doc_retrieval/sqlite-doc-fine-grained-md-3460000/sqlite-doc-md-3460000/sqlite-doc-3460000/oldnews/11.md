### 2015\-01\-30 \- Release 3\.8\.8\.2


> The 3\.8\.8\.2 patch release fixes a single minor problem: It ensures
>  that the [sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)](c3ref/wal_checkpoint.html) operation will always truncate
>  the [write\-ahead log](wal.html) even if log had already been reset and contained
>  no new content. It is unclear if this is a bug fix or a new feature.
> 
> 
> Something like this would normally go into the next regularly scheduled
>  release, but a prominent SQLite user needed the change in a hurry so
>  we were happy to rush it out via this patch.
> 
> 
> There is no reason to upgrade unless you actually need the enhanced
>  behavior of [sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)](c3ref/wal_checkpoint.html).
