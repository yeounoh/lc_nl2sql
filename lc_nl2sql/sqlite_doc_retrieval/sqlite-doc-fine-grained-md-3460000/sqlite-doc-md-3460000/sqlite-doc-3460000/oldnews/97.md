> While stress\-testing the
>  [soft\_heap\_limit](c3ref/soft_heap_limit.html)
>  feature, a bug that could lead to
>  database corruption was discovered and fixed.
>  Though the consequences of this bug are severe, the chances of hitting
>  it in a typical application are remote. Upgrading is recommended
>  only if you use the
>  [sqlite3\_soft\_heap\_limit](c3ref/soft_heap_limit.html)
>  interface.
