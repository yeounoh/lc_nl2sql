### 2014\-10\-30 \- Release 3\.8\.7\.1


> SQLite [version 3\.8\.7\.1](releaselog/3_8_7_1.html) is a bug\-fix release.
> 
> 
> The primary reason for this bug\-fix release is to address a problem with
>  updating the value of fields at the end of a table that were added
>  using [ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN](lang_altertable.html). This problem
>  [1](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/43107840f1c02) first appeared in the
>  3\.8\.7 release.
> 
> 
> Another minor annoyance in the 3\.8\.7 release was the fact that the
>  Android build tried to use the strchrnul() function from the standard
>  C library but that function is not available on Android. Android builds
>  had to add \-DHAVE\_STRCHRNUL\=0 to work around the problem. This patch
>  fixes that so that Android builds should now work without any changes.
> 
> 
> The operation of [PRAGMA journal\_mode\=TRUNCATE](pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode) has been enhanced so that
>  it invokes fsync() after truncating the journal file when
>  [PRAGMA synchronous\=FULL](pragma.html#pragma_synchronous). This helps to preserve transaction durability
>  in the case of a power loss occurring shortly after commit.
> 
> 
> Finally, a couple of long\-standing and obscure problems associated with run
>  UPDATE and DELETE on VIEWs were fixed.
>

> The [changes from 3\.8\.7](https://www.sqlite.org/src/vdiff?from=e4ab094f8afce0817f4074e823fabe59fc29ebb4&to=83afe23e553e802c0947c80d0ffdd120423e7c52&sbs=1) are minimal.
