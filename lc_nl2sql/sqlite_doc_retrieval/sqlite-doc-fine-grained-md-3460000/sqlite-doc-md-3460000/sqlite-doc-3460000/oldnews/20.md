> In addition to bug fixes, the 3\.8\.5 release adds improvements to the
>  query planner, especially regarding sorting using indices and handling
>  OR terms
>  in the WHERE clause for WITHOUT ROWID tables. The ".system" and
>  ".once" dot\-commands were added to the command\-line interface. And
>  there were enhancements to the FTS4 and RTREE virtual tables. See
