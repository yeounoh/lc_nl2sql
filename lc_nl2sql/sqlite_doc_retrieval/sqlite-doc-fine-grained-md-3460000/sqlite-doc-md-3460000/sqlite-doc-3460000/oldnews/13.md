### 2015\-01\-16 \- Release 3\.8\.8


> SQLite [version 3\.8\.8](releaselog/3_8_8.html) is a regularly schedule maintenance release of
>  SQLite.
> 
> 
> There are no dramatic new features or performance enhancements in this
>  release, merely incremental improvements. Most of the performance gain
>  in this release comes from refactoring the B\-Tree rebalancing logic to
>  avoid unnecessary memcpy() operations. New features include the
>  [PRAGMA data\_version](pragma.html#pragma_data_version) statement and the ability to accept a
>  [VALUES clause](lang_select.html#values) with no arbitrary limit on the number of rows.
>  Several obscure bugs have been fixed, including some multithreading
>  races and a work\-around for a compiler bug on some Macs.
> 
> 
> See the [change log](releaselog/3_8_8.html) for a longer list of
>  enhancements and bug fixes.
