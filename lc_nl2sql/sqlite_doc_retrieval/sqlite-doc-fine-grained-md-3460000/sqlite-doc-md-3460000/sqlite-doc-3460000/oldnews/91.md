### 2007\-12\-14 \- Version 3\.5\.4


> Version 3\.5\.4 fixes a long\-standing but obscure bug in UPDATE and
>  DELETE which might cause database corruption. (See ticket \#2832\.)
>  Upgrading is recommended for all users.
>  This release also brings the processing of ORDER BY statements into
>  compliance with standard SQL. This could, in theory, cause problems
>  for existing applications that depend on the older, buggy behavior.
>  See ticket \#2822 for additional information.
