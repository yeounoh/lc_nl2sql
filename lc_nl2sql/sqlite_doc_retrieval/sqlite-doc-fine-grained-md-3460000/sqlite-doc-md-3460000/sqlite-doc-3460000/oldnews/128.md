### 2005\-03\-21 \- Version 3\.2\.0


> The primary purpose for version 3\.2\.0 is to add support for
>  [ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN](lang_altertable.html).
>  The new ADD COLUMN capability is made
>  possible by AOL developers supporting and embracing great
>  open\-source software. Thanks, AOL!
>  Version 3\.2\.0 also fixes an obscure but serious bug that was discovered
>  just prior to release. If you have a multi\-statement transaction and
>  within that transaction an UPDATE or INSERT statement fails due to a
>  constraint, then you try to rollback the whole transaction, the rollback
>  might not work correctly. See
>  Ticket \#1171 for details. Upgrading is recommended for all users.
