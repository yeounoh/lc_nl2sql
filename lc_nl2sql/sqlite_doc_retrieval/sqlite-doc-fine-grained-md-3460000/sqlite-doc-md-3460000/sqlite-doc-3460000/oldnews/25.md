### 2014\-02\-11 \- Release 3\.8\.3\.1


> SQLite [version 3\.8\.3\.1](releaselog/3_8_3_1.html) fixes a bug present in versions 3\.8\.1,
>  3\.8\.2 and 3\.8\.3 that can cause queries to omit valid output rows.
>  Upgrading from those versions is recommended.
> 
> 
> The problem only comes up if SQLite is compiled with either the
>  [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT3](compile.html#enable_stat3) or [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT4](compile.html#enable_stat4) compile\-time options.
>  In that case, if a query has a WHERE clause that contains expressions
>  like this:
>  
> > WHERE (expr1 OR expr2 OR ... OR exprN) AND column IS NOT NULL
> 
> 
>  Where all of expr1 through exprN are suitable for use by indexes,
>  then during query planning SQLite might mistakenly converted
>  the "column IS NOT NULL" term into "column\>NULL". But the latter
>  term is never true, and so the query would return no rows.
> 
> 
> The trouble ticket for this bug is
>  \[[4c86b126f2](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/4c86b126f2)].
>  It is recommended that all users upgrade to avoid this problem.
