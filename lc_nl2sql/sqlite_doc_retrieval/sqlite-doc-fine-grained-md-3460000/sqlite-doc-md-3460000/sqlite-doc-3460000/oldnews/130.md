### 2005\-03\-11 \- Versions 3\.1\.4 and 3\.1\.5 Released


> Version 3\.1\.4 fixes a critical bug that could cause database corruption
>  if the autovacuum mode of version 3\.1\.0 is turned on (it is off by
>  default) and a CREATE UNIQUE INDEX is executed within a transaction but
>  fails because the indexed columns are not unique. Anyone using the
>  autovacuum feature and unique indices should upgrade.
>  Version 3\.1\.5 adds the ability to disable
>  the F\_FULLFSYNC ioctl() in OS\-X by setting "PRAGMA synchronous\=on" instead
>  of the default "PRAGMA synchronous\=full". There was an attempt to add
>  this capability in 3\.1\.4 but it did not work due to a spelling error.
