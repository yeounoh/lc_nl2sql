### 2011\-11\-01 \- Version 3\.7\.9


> SQLite [version 3\.7\.9](releaselog/3_7_9.html) is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
>  Upgrading from version 3\.7\.6\.3, 3\.7\.7, 3\.7\.7\.1, and 3\.7\.8 is optional.
>  Upgrading from other versions is recommended.
>  The [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT2](compile.html#enable_stat2) compile\-time option is now a no\-op. The enhanced
>  query\-planner functionality formerly available using SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT2
>  is now available through [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT3](compile.html#enable_stat3). The enhanced query planning
>  is still disabled by default. However, future releases of SQLite might
>  convert STAT3 from an enable\-option to a disable\-option so that it is
>  available by default and is only omitted upon request.
> 
> 
>  The [FTS4](fts3.html#fts4) full\-text search engine has been enhanced such that tokens in
>  the search string that begin with "^" must be the first token in their
>  respective columns in order to match. Formerly, "^" characters in the
>  search string were simply ignored. Hence, if a legacy application was
>  including "^" characters in FTS4 search strings, thinking that they would
>  always be ignored, then those legacy applications might break with this
>  update. The fix is simply remove the "^" characters from the search
>  string.
> 
> 
>  See the [change summary](releaselog/3_7_9.html) for additional changes associated
>  with this release.
