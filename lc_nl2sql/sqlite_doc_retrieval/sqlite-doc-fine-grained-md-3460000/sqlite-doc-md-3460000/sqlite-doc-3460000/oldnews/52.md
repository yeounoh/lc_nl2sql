### 2011\-04\-13 \- Version 3\.7\.6\.1


> SQLite [version 3\.7\.6\.1](releaselog/3_7_6_1.html) fixes a single bug in 3\.7\.6 that can cause a
>  segfault if [SQLITE\_FCNTL\_SIZE\_HINT](c3ref/c_fcntl_begin_atomic_write.html#sqlitefcntlsizehint) is used on a Unix build that has
>  SQLITE\_ENABLE\_LOCKING\_MODE set to 0 and is compiled with
>  HAVE\_POSIX\_FALLOCATE.
>  Upgrading from 3\.7\.6 is only needed for users effected by the
>  configuration\-specific bug described above. There are no other changes
>  to the code.
