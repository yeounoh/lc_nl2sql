### 2004\-06\-18 \- Version 3\.0\.0 (alpha) Released


> The first alpha release of SQLite version 3\.0 is available for
>  public review and comment. Version 3\.0 enhances internationalization support
>  through the use of UTF\-16 and user\-defined text collating sequences.
>  BLOBs can now be stored directly, without encoding.
>  A new file format results in databases that are 25% smaller (depending
>  on content). The code is also a little faster. In spite of the many
>  new features, the library footprint is still less than 240KB
>  (x86, gcc \-O1\).
>  [Additional information](version3.html).
>  Our intent is to freeze the file format and API on 2004\-07\-01\.
>  Users are encouraged to review and evaluate this alpha release carefully
>  and submit any feedback prior to that date.
> 
> 
>  The 2\.8 series of SQLite will continue to be supported with bug
>  fixes for the foreseeable future.
