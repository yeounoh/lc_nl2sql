### 2011\-04\-17 \- Version 3\.7\.6\.2


> SQLite [version 3\.7\.6\.2](releaselog/3_7_6_2.html) adds a one\-line bug fix to 3\.7\.6\.1 that enables
>  pthreads to work correctly on NetBSD. The problem was a faulty function
>  signature for the open system call. The problem does not appear to have
>  any adverse impact on any system other than NetBSD.
>  Upgrading from version 3\.7\.6\.1 is only needed on NetBSD.
