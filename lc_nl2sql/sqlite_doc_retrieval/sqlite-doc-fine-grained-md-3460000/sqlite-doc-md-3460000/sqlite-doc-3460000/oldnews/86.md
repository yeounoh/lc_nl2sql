### 2008\-05\-12 \- Version 3\.5\.9


> Version 3\.5\.9 adds a new experimental [PRAGMA](pragma.html#syntax): [journal\_mode](pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode).
>  Setting the journal mode to PERSIST can provide performance improvement
>  on systems where deleting a file is expensive. The PERSIST journal
>  mode is still considered experimental and should be used with caution
>  pending further testing.
>  Version 3\.5\.9 is intended to be the last stable release prior to
>  version 3\.6\.0\. Version 3\.6\.0 will make incompatible changes to the
>  [sqlite3\_vfs](c3ref/vfs.html) VFS layer in order to address deficiencies in the original
>  design. These incompatibilities will only effect programmers who
>  write their own custom VFS layers (typically embedded device builders).
>  The planned VFS changes will be much smaller
>  than the changes that occurred on the
>  [3\.4\.2 to 3\.5\.0 transaction](34to35.html) that occurred last
>  September.
> 
> 
>  This release of SQLite is considered stable and ready for production use.
