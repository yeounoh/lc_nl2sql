### 2014\-03\-26 \- Release 3\.8\.4\.2


> The code changes that resulted in the performance improvements
>  in [version 3\.8\.4](releaselog/3_8_4.html) missed a single buffer overflow test, which could
>  result in a read past the end of a buffer while searching a database
>  that is corrupted in a particular way. [Version 3\.8\.4\.2](releaselog/3_8_4_2.html) fixes that
>  problem using a
>  [one\-line patch](https://www.sqlite.org/src/fdiff?v1=e45e3f9daf38c5be&v2=714df4e1c82f629d&sbs=1).
> 
> 
> We are not aware of any problems in [version 3\.8\.4](releaselog/3_8_4.html)
>  when working with well\-formed database files. The problem fixed by this
>  release only comes up when reading corrupt database files.
