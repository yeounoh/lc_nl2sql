### 2010\-August\-24 \- Version 3\.7\.2


> SQLite [version 3\.7\.2](releaselog/3_7_2.html) fixes a long\-standing bug that can cause the
>  database [free\-page list](fileformat2.html#freelist) to go corrupt if [incremental\_vacuum](pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum) is used
>  multiple times to
>  partially reduce the size of a database file that contains many hundreds
>  of unused database pages. The original bug reports together with links
>  to the patch that fixes it can be seen
>  [here](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/5e10420e8d).
>  This bug has been in the code for at least a year and possibly longer.
>  The bug has nothing to do with the versions 3\.7\.1 or 3\.7\.0 or any other
>  recent release. The fact that the bug was discovered (and fixed)
>  within hours of the 3\.7\.1 release is purely a coincidence.
> 
> 
>  The bug is impossible to hit without using [incremental\_vacuum](pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum) and is
>  very difficult to hit even with incremental\_vacuum. And the kind of
>  corruption that the bug causes can usually be fixed
>  simply by running [VACUUM](lang_vacuum.html). Nevertheless, because the bug can result
>  in database corruption, it is recommended that all SQLite users upgrade
>  to version 3\.7\.2 or later.
