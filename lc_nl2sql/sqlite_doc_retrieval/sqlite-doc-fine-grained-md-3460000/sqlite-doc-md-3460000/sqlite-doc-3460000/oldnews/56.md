### 2010\-October\-08 \- Version 3\.7\.3


> SQLite [version 3\.7\.3](releaselog/3_7_3.html) is a regularly scheduled bi\-monthly maintenance
>  release of SQLite. Upgrading from [version 3\.7\.2](releaselog/3_7_2.html) is optional.
>  Upgrading from all other releases is recommended.
>  This release adds two new interfaces (really just variations on existing
>  interfaces). The [sqlite3\_create\_function\_v2()](c3ref/create_function.html) interface adds a
>  destructor for the application\-data pointer. The new
>  [sqlite3\_soft\_heap\_limit64()](c3ref/hard_heap_limit64.html) interface allows the soft heap limit to
>  be set to a value greater than 231.
> 
> 
>  The [RTREE](rtree.html) extension has been enhanced with the ability to have an
>  [application\-defined query region](rtree.html#customquery). This might
>  be used, for example, to locate all objects within
>  the field of view of a camera.
> 
> 
>  The 3\.7\.3 release also includes some performance enhancements, including
>  query planner improvements, documentation updates,
>  and fixes to some very obscure bugs.
