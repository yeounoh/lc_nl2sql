### 2009\-10\-14 \- Version 3\.6\.19


> SQLite [version 3\.6\.19](releaselog/3_6_19.html) adds native support for
>  [foreign key constraints](foreignkeys.html), including deferred constraints and
>  cascading deletes. Enforcement of foreign keys is disabled by
>  default for backwards compatibility and must be turned on using
>  the [foreign\_keys pragma](pragma.html#pragma_foreign_keys).
>  Version 3\.6\.19 also adds support for the
>  [IS and IS NOT operators](lang_expr.html#isisnot). Formerly, SQLite (as most
>  other SQL database engines) supported IS NULL and IS NOT NULL. The
>  IS and IS NOT operators are generalizations that allow the right\-hand
>  side to be an arbitrary expression. IS and IS NOT work the same as
>  \=\= (equals) and !\= (not equals) except that with IS and IS NOT the
>  NULL values compare equal to one another.
