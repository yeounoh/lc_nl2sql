## Testing Services


The [Test Harness \#3 (TH3\)](https://sqlite.org/th3.html) is
a suite of test cases for SQLite that provide 100% branch test coverage
(and 100% modified condition/decision coverage) for the core SQLite in
an as\-deployed configuration using only published and documented interfaces.
TH3 is designed for use with embedded devices, and is compatible with
DO\-178B. Every release of the public\-domain SQLite is tested using TH3,
and so all users benefit from the TH3 tests. But the TH3 tests are not
themselves public. Hardware or system manufactures who want to have
TH3 test run on their systems can negotiate a service agreement to have
the SQLite Developers run those tests.
