## About The SQLite Team


Paid support options and products are provided by
Hipp, Wyrick \& Company, Inc., (Hwaci), a
[Georgia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state))
corporation
with headquarters in
[Charlotte, North Carolina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina) and has been in business since
1992\.
Hwaci has an international team of
employees and associates representing the best available talent.
We are a 100% engineering company. There is
no sales staff.
Our goal is to provide outstanding service and honest advice
without spin or sales\-talk.


Hwaci is a small company but it is
also closely held and debt\-free and has low
fixed costs, which means that it is largely immune to buy\-outs,
take\-overs, and market down\-turns. Hwaci intends to
continue operating in its current form, and at roughly its current
size until at least the year 2050\.
We expect to be here when you need us,
even if that need is many years in the future.
