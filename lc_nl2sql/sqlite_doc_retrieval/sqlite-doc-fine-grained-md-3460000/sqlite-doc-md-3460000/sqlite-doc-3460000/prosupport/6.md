## Software Licenses


The SQLite source code is in the
[public domain](https://sqlite.org/copyright.html),
and is free for use
by anyone and for any purpose. No license is required. However, some
users desire a license so that they can have warranty of title, or just
because their company lawyers say they need one. A
[perpetual license
and warranty of title](https://sqlite.org/purchase/license)
for the core SQLite source code is available for this purpose.


The
[SQLite Encryption
Extension (SEE)](https://sqlite.org/purchase/see),
the [ZIPVFS Extension](https://sqlite.org/purchase/zipvfs),
and the [Compressed and
Encrypted ReadOnly Database (CEROD)](https://sqlite.org/purchase/cerod) extension are enhanced versions
of SQLite that handle encrypted
and/or compressed databases. SEE can read and write encrypted databases.
SEE encrypts all database content, including metadata, so that the database
file appears as white noise. ZIPVFS
compresses the database on\-the\-fly using application\-supplied
compression and decompression functions.
CEROD reads a compressed database that is
also optionally encrypted. All of SEE, ZIPVFS, and CEROD are
supplied in source code form only; the licensee is responsible for
compiling the products for their chosen platform. It is not difficult
to compile any of these extension. All products come in the form of an
[{amalgamated source file}](amalgamation.html)
named "sqlite3\.c". So compiling SEE, ZIPVFS, or CEROD into an application
is simply a matter of substituting the SEE\-, ZIPVFS\-, or CEROD\-enabled sqlite3\.c
source file in place of the public\-domain sqlite3\.c source file and recompiling.
Licenses for SEE, ZIPVFS, and CEROD are perpetual.
All three extension can read and write ordinary,
uncompressed and unencrypted database files.
