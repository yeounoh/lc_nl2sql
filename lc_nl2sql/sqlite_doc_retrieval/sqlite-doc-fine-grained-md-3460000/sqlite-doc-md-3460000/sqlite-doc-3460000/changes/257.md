### 2003\-05\-17 (2\.8\.1\)

1. Reactivated the VACUUM command that reclaims unused disk space in
 a database file.
2. Added the ATTACH and DETACH commands to allow interacting with multiple
 database files at the same time.
3. Added support for TEMP triggers and indices.
4. Added support for in\-memory databases.
5. Removed the experimental sqlite\_open\_aux\_file(). Its function is
 subsumed in the new ATTACH command.
6. The precedence order for ON CONFLICT clauses was changed so that
 ON CONFLICT clauses on BEGIN statements have a higher precedence than
 ON CONFLICT clauses on constraints.
- Many, many bug fixes and compatibility enhancements.
