1. Bug fix: Ensure the cached KeyInfo objects (an internal abstraction not visible to the
 application) do not go stale when operating in [shared cache mode](sharedcache.html) and frequently closing
 and reopening some database connections while leaving other database connections on the
 same shared cache open continuously. Ticket
 [e4a18565a36884b00edf](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/e4a18565a36884b00edf).
- Bug fix: Recognize that any column in the right\-hand table of a LEFT JOIN can be
 NULL even if the column has a NOT NULL constraint. Do not apply optimizations that
 assume the column is never NULL. Ticket
