### 2007\-01\-22 (3\.3\.11\)

1. Fix another bug in the implementation of the new
[sqlite3\_prepare\_v2()](c3ref/prepare.html) API.
We'll get it right eventually...
2. Fix a bug in the IS NULL optimization that was added in version 3\.3\.9 \-
the bug was causing incorrect results on certain LEFT JOINs that included
in the WHERE clause an IS NULL constraint for the right table of the
LEFT JOIN.
3. Make AreFileApisANSI() a no\-op macro in WinCE since WinCE does not
support this function.
