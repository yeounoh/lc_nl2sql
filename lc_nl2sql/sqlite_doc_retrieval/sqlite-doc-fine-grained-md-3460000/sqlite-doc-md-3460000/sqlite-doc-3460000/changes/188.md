### 2008\-02\-06 (3\.5\.6\)

1. Fix a bug (ticket \#2913\)
that prevented virtual tables from working in a LEFT JOIN.
The problem was introduced into shortly before the 3\.5\.5 release.
2. Bring the OS/2 porting layer up\-to\-date.
3. Add the new [sqlite3\_result\_error\_code()](c3ref/result_blob.html) API and use it in the
implementation of [ATTACH](lang_attach.html) so that proper error codes are returned
when an [ATTACH](lang_attach.html) fails.
