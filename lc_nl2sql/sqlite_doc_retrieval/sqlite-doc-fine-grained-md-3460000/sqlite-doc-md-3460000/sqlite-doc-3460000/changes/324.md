### 2001\-04\-04 (1\.0\.28\)

1. Added limited support for transactions. At this point, transactions
 will do table locking on the GDBM backend. There is no support (yet)
 for rollback or atomic commit.
2. Added special column names ROWID, OID, and \_ROWID\_ that refer to the
 unique random integer key associated with every row of every table.
3. Additional tests added to the regression suite to cover the new ROWID
 feature and the TCL interface bugs mentioned below.
4. Changes to the [Lemon parser generator](lemon.html) to help it work better when
 compiled using MSVC.
5. Bug fixes in the TCL interface identified by Oleg Oleinick.
