1. Bug fix: Correctly handle functions that appear in the WHERE clause
 of a join.
2. When the PRAGMA vdbe\_trace\=ON is set, correctly print the P3 operand
 value when it is a pointer to a structure rather than a pointer to
 a string.
3. When inserting an explicit NULL into an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, convert
 the NULL value into a unique key automatically.
