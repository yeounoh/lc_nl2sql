### 2011\-04\-12 (3\.7\.6\)

1. Added the [sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint\_v2()](c3ref/wal_checkpoint_v2.html) interface and enhanced the
 [wal\_checkpoint pragma](pragma.html#pragma_wal_checkpoint) to support blocking checkpoints.
- Improvements to the query planner so that it makes better estimates of
 plan costs and hence does a better job of choosing the right plan,
 especially when [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT2](compile.html#enable_stat2) is used.
- Fix a bug which prevented deferred foreign key constraints from being
 enforced when [sqlite3\_finalize()](c3ref/finalize.html) was not
 called by one statement with a failed foreign key constraint prior to
 another statement with foreign key constraints running.
- Integer arithmetic operations that would have resulted in overflow
 are now performed using floating\-point instead.
- Increased the version number on the [VFS object](c3ref/vfs.html) to
 3 and added new methods xSetSysCall, xGetSysCall, and xNextSysCall
 used for doing full\-coverage testing.
- Increase the maximum value of [SQLITE\_MAX\_ATTACHED](limits.html#max_attached) from 30 to 62
 (though the default value remains at 10\).
- Enhancements to FTS4:
	1. Added the [fts4aux](fts3.html#fts4aux) table
	 - Added support for [compressed FTS4 content](fts3.html#*fts4compression)- Enhance the [ANALYZE](lang_analyze.html) command to support the name of an index
 as its argument, in order to analyze just that one index.
- Added the "unix\-excl" built\-in VFS on unix and unix\-like platforms.
- SQLITE\_SOURCE\_ID:
 "2011\-04\-12 01:58:40 f9d43fa363d54beab6f45db005abac0a7c0c47a7"
- SHA1 for sqlite3\.c: f38df08547efae0ff4343da607b723f588bbd66b
