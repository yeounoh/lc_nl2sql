1. Fix a bug (ticket [4c86b126f2](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/4c86b126f2))
 that causes rows to go missing on some queries with OR clauses and
 IS NOT NULL operators in the WHERE clause, when the [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT3](compile.html#enable_stat3)
 or [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT4](compile.html#enable_stat4) compile\-time options are used.
- Fix a harmless compiler warning that was causing problems for VS2013\.
