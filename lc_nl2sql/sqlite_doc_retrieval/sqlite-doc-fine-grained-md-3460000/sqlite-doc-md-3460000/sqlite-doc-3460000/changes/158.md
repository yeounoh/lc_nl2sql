### 2009\-12\-07 (3\.6\.21\)

1. The SQL output resulting from [sqlite3\_trace()](c3ref/profile.html) is now modified to include
the values of [bound parameters](lang_expr.html#varparam).
- Performance optimizations targeting a specific use case from
a single high\-profile user of SQLite. A 12% reduction in the number of
CPU operations is achieved (as measured by Valgrind). Actual performance
improvements in practice may vary depending on workload. Changes
include:
	1. The [ifnull()](lang_corefunc.html#ifnull) and [coalesce()](lang_corefunc.html#coalesce) SQL functions are now implemented
	 using in\-line VDBE code rather than calling external functions, so that
	 unused arguments need never be evaluated.
	 - The [substr()](lang_corefunc.html#substr) SQL function does not bother to measure the length
	 its entire input string if it is only computing a prefix
	 - Unnecessary OP\_IsNull, OP\_Affinity, and OP\_MustBeInt VDBE opcodes
	 are suppressed
	 - Various code refactorizations for performance- The FTS3 extension has undergone a major rework and cleanup.
New [FTS3 documentation](fts3.html) is now available.
- The [SQLITE\_SECURE\_DELETE](compile.html#secure_delete) compile\-time option fixed to make sure that
content is deleted even when the [truncate optimization](lang_delete.html#truncateopt) applies.
- Improvements to "dot\-command" handling in the
[Command Line Interface](cli.html).
- Other minor bug fixes and documentation enhancements.
