1. Fix the [REPLACE](lang_replace.html) statement for
 [WITHOUT ROWID](withoutrowid.html) tables that lack secondary indexes so that
 it works correctly with triggers and foreign keys. This was a new bug
 caused by performance optimizations added in version 3\.16\.0\.
 Ticket [30027b613b4](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/30027b613b4)- Fix the [sqlite3\_value\_text()](c3ref/value_blob.html) interface so that it correctly
 translates content generated by [zeroblob()](lang_corefunc.html#zeroblob) into a string of all
 0x00 characters. This is a long\-standing issue discovered after the
 3\.16\.1 release by [OSS\-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz)- Fix the bytecode generator to deal with a subquery in the FROM clause
 that is itself a UNION ALL where one side of the UNION ALL is a view
 that contains an ORDER BY. This is a long\-standing issue that was
 discovered after the release of 3\.16\.1\. See ticket
 [190c2507](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/190c2507).
- Adjust the [sqlite3\_column\_count()](c3ref/column_count.html) API so it more often returns the same
 values for [PRAGMA](pragma.html#syntax) statements as it did in prior releases, to
 minimize disruption to applications that might be using that
 interface in unexpected ways.
