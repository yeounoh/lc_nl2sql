### 2002\-02\-03 (2\.3\.0\)

1. Fix a serious bug in the INSERT command which was causing data to go
 into the wrong columns if the data source was a SELECT and the INSERT
 clauses specified its columns in some order other than the default.
2. Added the ability to resolve constraint conflicts is ways other than
 an abort and rollback. See the documentation on the "ON CONFLICT"
 clause for details.
3. Temporary files are now automatically deleted by the operating system
 when closed. There are no more dangling temporary files on a program
 crash. (If the OS crashes, fsck will delete the file after reboot
 under Unix. I do not know what happens under Windows.)
4. NOT NULL constraints are honored.
5. The COPY command puts NULLs in columns whose data is '\\N'.
6. In the COPY command, backslash can now be used to escape a newline.
7. Added the SANITY\_CHECK pragma.
