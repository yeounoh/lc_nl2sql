### 2009\-05\-07 (3\.6\.14\)

1. Added the optional [asynchronous VFS](asyncvfs.html) module.
2. Enhanced the query optimizer so that [virtual tables](vtab.html) are able to
 make use of OR and IN operators in the WHERE clause.
3. Speed improvements in the btree and pager layers.
4. Added the [SQLITE\_HAVE\_ISNAN](compile.html#have_isnan) compile\-time option which will cause
 the isnan() function from the standard math library to be used instead
 of SQLite's own home\-brew NaN checker.
5. Countless minor bug fixes, documentation improvements, new and
 improved test cases, and code simplifications and cleanups.
