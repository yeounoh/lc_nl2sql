### 2002\-01\-09 (2\.2\.1\)

1. Bug fix: An attempt to delete a single row of a table with a WHERE
 clause of "ROWID\=x" when no such rowid exists was causing an error.
2. Bug fix: Passing in a NULL as the 3rd parameter to **sqlite\_open()**
 would sometimes cause a coredump.
3. Bug fix: DROP TABLE followed by a CREATE TABLE with the same name all
 within a single transaction was causing a coredump.
4. Makefile updates from A. Rottmann
