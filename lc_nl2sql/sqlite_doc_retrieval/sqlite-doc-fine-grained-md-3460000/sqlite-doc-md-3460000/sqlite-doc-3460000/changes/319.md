### 2001\-09\-20 (2\.0\-alpha\-2\)

1. Initial release of version 2\.0\. The idea of renaming the library
 to "SQLus" was abandoned in favor of keeping the "SQLite" name and
 bumping the major version number.
2. The pager and btree subsystems added back. They are now the only
 available backend.
3. The Dbbe abstraction and the GDBM and memory drivers were removed.
4. Copyright on all code was disclaimed. The library is now in the
 public domain.
