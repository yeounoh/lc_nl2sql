1. Columns of type INTEGER PRIMARY KEY are actually used as the primary
 key in underlying B\-Tree representation of the table.
2. Several obscure, unrelated bugs were found and fixed while
 implemented the integer primary key change of the previous bullet.
3. Added the ability to specify "\*" as part of a larger column list in
 the result section of a SELECT statement. For example:
 "**SELECT rowid, \* FROM table1;**".
4. Updates to comments and documentation.
