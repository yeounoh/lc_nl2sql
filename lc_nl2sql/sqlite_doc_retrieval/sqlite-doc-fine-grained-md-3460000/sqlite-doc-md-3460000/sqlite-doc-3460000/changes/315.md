### 2001\-10\-02 (2\.0\.1\)

1. Remove some C\+\+ style comments from btree.c so that it will compile
 using compilers other than gcc.
2. The ".dump" output from the shell does not work if there are embedded
 newlines anywhere in the data. This is an old bug that was carried
 forward from version 1\.0\. To fix it, the ".dump" output no longer
 uses the COPY command. It instead generates INSERT statements.
3. Extend the expression syntax to support "expr NOT NULL" (with a
 space between the "NOT" and the "NULL") in addition to "expr NOTNULL"
 (with no space).
