### 2001\-10\-22 (2\.0\.7\)

1. Any UTF\-8 character or ISO8859 character can be used as part of
 an identifier.
2. Patches from Christian Werner to improve ODBC compatibility and to
 fix a bug in the round() function.
3. Plug some memory leaks that use to occur if malloc() failed.
 We have been and continue to be memory leak free as long as
 malloc() works.
4. Changes to some test scripts so that they work on Windows in
 addition to Unix.
