### 2001\-12\-15 (2\.1\.7\)

1. Fix a bug in **CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE** which was causing the
 table to be initially allocated in the main database file instead
 of in the separate temporary file. This bug could cause the library
 to suffer an assertion failure and it could cause "page leaks" in the
 main database file.
- Fix a bug in the b\-tree subsystem that could sometimes cause the first
 row of a table to be repeated during a database scan.
