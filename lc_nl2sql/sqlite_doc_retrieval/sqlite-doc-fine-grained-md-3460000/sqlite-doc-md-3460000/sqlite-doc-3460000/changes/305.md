### 2001\-11\-23 (2\.1\.2\)

1. Changes to support 64\-bit architectures.
2. Fix a bug in the locking protocol.
3. Fix a bug that could (rarely) cause the database to become
 unreadable after a DROP TABLE due to corruption to the SQLITE\_MASTER
 table.
4. Change the code so that version 2\.1\.1 databases that were rendered
 unreadable by the above bug can be read by this version of
 the library even though the SQLITE\_MASTER table is (slightly)
 corrupted.
