1. Revert the data layout for an internal\-use\-only SQLite data structure.
 Applications that use SQLite should never reference internal SQLite
 data structures, but some do anyhow, and a change to one such
 data structure in 3\.30\.0 broke a popular and widely\-deployed
 application. Reverting that change in SQLite, at least temporarily,
 gives developers of misbehaving applications time to fix their code.
- Fix a typos in the sqlite3ext.h header file that prevented the
 [sqlite3\_stmt\_isexplain()](c3ref/stmt_isexplain.html) and [sqlite3\_value\_frombind()](c3ref/value_blob.html) interfaces
 from being called from [run\-time loadable extensions](loadext.html).
