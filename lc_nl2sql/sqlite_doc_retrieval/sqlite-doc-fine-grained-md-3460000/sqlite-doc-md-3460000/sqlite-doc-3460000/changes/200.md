### 2007\-04\-09 (3\.3\.15\)

1. Fix a bug introduced in 3\.3\.14 that caused a rollback of
 CREATE TEMP TABLE to leave the database connection wedged.
2. Fix a bug that caused an extra NULL row to be returned when
 a descending query was interrupted by a change to the database.
3. The FOR EACH STATEMENT clause on a trigger now causes a syntax
 error. It used to be silently ignored.
4. Fix an obscure and relatively harmless problem that might have caused
 a resource leak following an I/O error.
5. Many improvements to the test suite. Test coverage now exceeded 98%
