### 2000\-05\-30

1. Added the **LIKE** operator.
2. Added a **GLOB** operator: similar to **LIKE**
but it uses Unix shell globbing wildcards instead of the '%'
and '\_' wildcards of SQL.
3. Added the **COPY** command patterned after
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) so that SQLite
can now read the output of the **pg\_dump** database dump utility
of PostgreSQL.
4. Added a **VACUUM** command that calls the
**gdbm\_reorganize()** function on the underlying database
files.
5. And many, many bug fixes...
