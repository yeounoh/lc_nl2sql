### 2001\-10\-09 (2\.0\.2\)

1. Fix two bugs in the locking protocol. (One was masking the other.)
2. Removed some unused "\#include " that were causing problems
 for VC\+\+.
3. Fixed **sqlite.h** so that it is usable from C\+\+
4. Added the FULL\_COLUMN\_NAMES pragma. When set to "ON", the names of
 columns are reported back as TABLE.COLUMN instead of just COLUMN.
5. Added the TABLE\_INFO() and INDEX\_INFO() pragmas to help support the
 ODBC interface.
6. Added support for TEMPORARY tables and indices.
