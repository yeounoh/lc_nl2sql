### 2018\-09\-18 (3\.25\.1\)

1. Extra sanity checking added to ALTER TABLE in the 3\.25\.0 release
 sometimes raises a false\-positive
 when the table being modified has a trigger that
 updates a virtual table. The false\-positive caused the ALTER
 TABLE to rollback, thus leaving the schema unchanged.

- The fix in the 3\.25\.0 release for the endless\-loop in the byte\-code
 associated with the ORDER BY LIMIT optimization did not work for
 some queries involving window functions. An additional correction
 is required. Ticket
