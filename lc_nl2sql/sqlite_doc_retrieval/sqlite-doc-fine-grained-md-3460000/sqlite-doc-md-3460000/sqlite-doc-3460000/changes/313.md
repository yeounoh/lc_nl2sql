### 2001\-10\-13 (2\.0\.3\)

1. Bug fix: the **sqlite\_busy\_timeout()** function was delaying 1000
 times too long before failing.
2. Bug fix: an assertion was failing if the disk holding the database
 file became full or stopped accepting writes for some other reason.
 New tests were added to detect similar problems in the future.
3. Added new operators: **\&** (bitwise\-and)
 **\|** (bitwise\-or), **\~** (ones\-complement),
 **\<\<** (shift left), **\>\>** (shift right).
4. Added new functions: **round()** and **abs()**.
