### 2013\-12\-06 (3\.8\.2\)

1. Changed the defined behavior for the [CAST expression](lang_expr.html#castexpr) when floating point values
 greater than \+9223372036854775807 are cast into integers so that the
 result is the largest possible integer, \+9223372036854775807, instead of
 the smallest possible integer, \-9223372036854775808\. After this change,
 CAST(9223372036854775809\.0 as INT) yields \+9223372036854775807 instead
 of \-9223372036854775808\.
 **← Potentially Incompatible Change!**- Added support for [WITHOUT ROWID](withoutrowid.html) tables.
- Added the [skip\-scan optimization](optoverview.html#skipscan) to the query planner.
- Extended the [virtual table](vtab.html) interface, and in particular the
 [sqlite3\_index\_info](c3ref/index_info.html) object to allow a virtual table to report its estimate
 on the number of rows that will be returned by a query.
- Update the [R\-Tree extension](rtree.html) to make use of the enhanced virtual table
 interface.
- Add the [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_EXPLAIN\_COMMENTS](compile.html#enable_explain_comments) compile\-time option.
- Enhanced the comments that are inserted into [EXPLAIN](lang_explain.html) output when the
 [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_EXPLAIN\_COMMENTS](compile.html#enable_explain_comments) compile\-time option is enabled.
- Performance enhancements in the VDBE, especially to the OP\_Column opcode.
- Factor constant subexpressions in inner loops out to the initialization code
 in prepared statements.
- Enhanced the ".explain" output formatting of the [command\-line shell](cli.html)
 so that loops are indented to better show the structure of the program.
- Enhanced the ".timer" feature of the [command\-line shell](cli.html) so that it
 shows wall\-clock time in addition to system and user times.
