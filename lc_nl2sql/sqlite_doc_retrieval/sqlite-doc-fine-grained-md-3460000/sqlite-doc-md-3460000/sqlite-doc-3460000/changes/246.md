1. Fix a bug that will might corrupt the rollback journal if a power failure
 or external program halt occurs in the middle of a COMMIT. The corrupt
 journal can lead to database corruption when it is rolled back.
2. Reduce the size and increase the speed of various modules, especially
 the virtual machine.
3. Allow "\<expr\> IN \<table\>" as a shorthand for
 "\<expr\> IN (SELECT \* FROM \<table\>".
4. Optimizations to the sqlite\_mprintf() routine.
5. Make sure the MIN() and MAX() optimizations work within subqueries.
