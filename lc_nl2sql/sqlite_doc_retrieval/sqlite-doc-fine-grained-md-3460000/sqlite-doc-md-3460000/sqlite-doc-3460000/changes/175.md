### 2008\-12\-16 (3\.6\.7\)

1. Reorganize the Unix interface in os\_unix.c
2. Added support for "Proxy Locking" on Mac OS X.
3. Changed the prototype of the [sqlite3\_auto\_extension()](c3ref/auto_extension.html) interface in a
 way that is backwards compatible but which might cause warnings in new
 builds of applications that use that interface.
4. Changed the signature of the xDlSym method of the [sqlite3\_vfs](c3ref/vfs.html) object
 in a way that is backwards compatible but which might cause
 compiler warnings.
5. Added superfluous casts and variable initializations in order
