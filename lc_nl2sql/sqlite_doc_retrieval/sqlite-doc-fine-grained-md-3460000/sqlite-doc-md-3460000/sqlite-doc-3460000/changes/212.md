### 2006\-01\-31 (3\.3\.3\)

1. Removed support for an ON CONFLICT clause on CREATE INDEX \- it never
worked correctly so this should not present any backward compatibility
problems.
2. Authorizer callback now notified of ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN commands
3. After any changes to the TEMP database schema, all prepared statements
are invalidated and must be recreated using a new call to
sqlite3\_prepare()
4. Other minor bug fixes in preparation for the first stable release
of version 3\.3
