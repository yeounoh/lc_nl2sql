### 2005\-08\-21 (3\.2\.3\)

1. Added support for the CAST operator
2. Tcl interface allows BLOB values to be transferred to user\-defined
functions
3. Added the "transaction" method to the Tcl interface
4. Allow the DEFAULT value of a column to call functions that have constant
operands
5. Added the ANALYZE command for gathering statistics on indices and
using those statistics when picking an index in the optimizer
6. Remove the limit (formerly 100\) on the number of terms in the
WHERE clause
7. The right\-hand side of the IN operator can now be a list of expressions
instead of just a list of constants
8. Rework the optimizer so that it is able to make better use of indices
9. The order of tables in a join is adjusted automatically to make
better use of indices
10. The IN operator is now a candidate for optimization even if the left\-hand
side is not the left\-most term of the index. Multiple IN operators can be
used with the same index.
11. WHERE clause expressions using BETWEEN and OR are now candidates
for optimization
12. Added the "case\_sensitive\_like" pragma and the SQLITE\_CASE\_SENSITIVE\_LIKE
compile\-time option to set its default value to "on".
13. Use indices to help with GLOB expressions and LIKE expressions too
when the case\_sensitive\_like pragma is enabled
