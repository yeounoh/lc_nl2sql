### 2002\-12\-17 (2\.7\.4\)

1. Database files can now grow to be up to 2^41 bytes. The old limit
 was 2^31 bytes.
2. The optimizer will now scan tables in the reverse if doing so will
 satisfy an ORDER BY ... DESC clause.
3. The full pathname of the database file is now remembered even if
 a relative path is passed into sqlite\_open(). This allows
 the library to continue operating correctly after a chdir().
4. Speed improvements in the VDBE.
5. Lots of little bug fixes.
