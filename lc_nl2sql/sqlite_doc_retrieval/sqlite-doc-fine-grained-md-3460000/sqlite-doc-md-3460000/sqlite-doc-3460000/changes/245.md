### 2004\-03\-08 (2\.8\.13\)

1. Refactor parts of the code in order to make the code footprint
 smaller. The code is now also a little bit faster.
2. sqlite\_exec() is now implemented as a wrapper around sqlite\_compile()
 and sqlite\_step().
3. The built\-in min() and max() functions now honor the difference between
 NUMERIC and TEXT datatypes. Formerly, min() and max() always assumed
 their arguments were of type NUMERIC.
4. New HH:MM:SS modifier to the built\-in date/time functions.
5. Experimental sqlite\_last\_statement\_changes() API added. Fixed
 the last\_insert\_rowid() function so that it works correctly with
 triggers.
6. Add functions prototypes for the database encryption API.
7. Fix several nuisance bugs.
