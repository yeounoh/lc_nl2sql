### 2001\-04\-05 (1\.0\.29\)

1. The library now assumes data is stored as UTF\-8 if the \-\-enable\-utf8
 option is given to configure. The default behavior is to assume
 iso8859\-x, as it has always done. This only makes a difference for
 LIKE and GLOB operators and the LENGTH and SUBSTR functions.
2. If the library is not configured for UTF\-8 and the Tcl library
 is one of the newer ones that uses UTF\-8 internally,
 then a conversion from UTF\-8 to iso8859 and
 back again is done inside the TCL interface.
