 support for the [journal\_mode](pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode) PRAGMA and persistent journal.

3. Fix a performance regression on LEFT JOIN (see ticket \#3015\)
 that was mistakenly introduced in [version 3\.5\.8](#version_3_5_8).
4. Performance enhancement: Reengineer the internal routines used
 to interpret and render variable\-length integers.
5. Fix a buffer\-overrun problem in [sqlite3\_mprintf()](c3ref/mprintf.html) which occurs

6. Always convert IEEE floating point NaN values into NULL during
 processing. (Ticket \#3060\)

 it is able to continue after the lock is released. (Ticket \#3093\)
