### 2002\-05\-03 (2\.4\.10\)

1. Bug fix: Generate correct column headers when a compound SELECT is used
 as a subquery.
2. Added the sqlite\_encode\_binary() and sqlite\_decode\_binary() functions to
 the source tree. But they are not yet linked into the library.
3. Documentation updates.
4. Export the sqlite\_changes() function from Windows DLLs.
5. Bug fix: Do not attempt the subquery flattening optimization on queries
 that lack a FROM clause. To do so causes a segfault.
