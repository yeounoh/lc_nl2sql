### 2018\-09\-25 (3\.25\.2\)

1. Add the [PRAGMA legacy\_alter\_table\=ON](pragma.html#pragma_legacy_alter_table) command that causes the
 "ALTER TABLE RENAME" command to behave as it did in SQLite versions 3\.24\.0
 and earlier: references to the renamed table inside the bodies of triggers
 and views are not updated. This new pragma provides a compatibility
 work around for older programs that expected the older, wonky behavior
 of ALTER TABLE RENAME.
- Fix a problem with the new [window functions](windowfunctions.html) implementation that caused
 a malfunction when complicated expressions involving window functions were used
 inside of a view.
- Fixes for various other compiler warnings and minor problems associated
 with obscure configurations.
