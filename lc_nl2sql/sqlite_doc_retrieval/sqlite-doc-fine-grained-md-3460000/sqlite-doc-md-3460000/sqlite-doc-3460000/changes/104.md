### 2015\-02\-25 (3\.8\.8\.3\)

1. Fix a bug (ticket
 [2326c258d02ead33](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/2326c258d02ead33)) that can lead
 to incorrect results if the qualifying constraint of a [partial index](partialindex.html) appears in the
 ON clause of a LEFT JOIN.
- Added the ability to link against the
 "[linenoise](https://github.com/antirez/linenoise)"
 command\-line editing library in unix builds of the [command\-line shell](cli.html).
