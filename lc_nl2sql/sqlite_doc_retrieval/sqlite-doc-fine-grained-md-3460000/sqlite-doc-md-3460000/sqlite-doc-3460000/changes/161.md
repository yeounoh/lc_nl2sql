### 2009\-10\-14 (3\.6\.19\)

1. Added support for [foreign key constraints](foreignkeys.html). Foreign key constraints
 are disabled by default. Use the [foreign\_keys pragma](pragma.html#pragma_foreign_keys) to turn them on.
- Generalized the IS and IS NOT operators to take arbitrary expressions
 on their right\-hand side.
- The [TCL Interface](tclsqlite.html) has been enhanced to use the
 [Non\-Recursive Engine (NRE)](http://www.tcl-lang.org/cgi-bin/tct/tip/322.html)
 interface to the TCL interpreter when linked against TCL 8\.6 or later.
- Fix a bug introduced in 3\.6\.18 that can lead to a segfault when an
 attempt is made to write on a read\-only database.
