### 2010\-08\-23 (3\.7\.1\)

1. Added new commands [SQLITE\_DBSTATUS\_SCHEMA\_USED](c3ref/c_dbstatus_options.html#sqlitedbstatusschemaused) and
 [SQLITE\_DBSTATUS\_STMT\_USED](c3ref/c_dbstatus_options.html#sqlitedbstatusstmtused) to the [sqlite3\_db\_status()](c3ref/db_status.html) interface, in
 order to report out the amount of memory used to hold the schema and
 prepared statements of a connection.
- Increase the maximum size of a database pages from 32KiB to 64KiB.
- Use the [LIKE optimization](optoverview.html#like_opt) even if the right\-hand side string contains
 no wildcards.
- Added the [SQLITE\_FCNTL\_CHUNK\_SIZE](c3ref/c_fcntl_begin_atomic_write.html#sqlitefcntlchunksize) verb to the [sqlite3\_file\_control()](c3ref/file_control.html)
 interface for both unix and windows, to cause database files to grow in
 large chunks in order to reduce disk fragmentation.
- Fixed a bug in the query planner that caused performance regressions
 relative to 3\.6\.23\.1 on some complex joins.
- Fixed a typo in the OS/2 backend.
- Refactored the pager module.
- The SQLITE\_MAX\_PAGE\_SIZE compile\-time option is now silently ignored.
 The maximum page size is hard\-coded at 65536 bytes.
