1. Added the fcnt() function to the SQL interpreter. The fcnt() function
 returns the number of database "Fetch" operations that have occurred.
 This function is designed for use in test scripts to verify that
 queries are efficient and appropriately optimized. Fcnt() has no other
 useful purpose, as far as I know.
2. Added a bunch more tests that take advantage of the new fcnt() function.
 The new tests did not uncover any new problems.
