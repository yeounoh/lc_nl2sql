1. Make sure VIEWs are created after their corresponding TABLEs in the
 output of the **.dump** command in the shell.
2. Speed improvements: Do not do synchronous updates on TEMP tables.
3. Many improvements and enhancements to the shell.
4. Make the GLOB and LIKE operators functions that can be overridden
 by a programmer. This allows, for example, the LIKE operator to
 be changed to be case sensitive.
