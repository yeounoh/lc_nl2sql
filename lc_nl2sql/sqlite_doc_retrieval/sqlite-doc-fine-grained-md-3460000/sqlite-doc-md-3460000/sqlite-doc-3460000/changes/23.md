### 2022\-06\-25 (3\.39\.0\)

1. Add (long overdue) support for [RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOIN](lang_select.html#rjoin).
- Add new binary comparison operators [IS NOT DISTINCT FROM](lang_expr.html#isdf) and [IS DISTINCT FROM](lang_expr.html#isdf)
 that are equivalent to IS and IS NOT, respective, for compatibility with
 PostgreSQL and SQL standards.
- Add a new return code (value "3") from the [sqlite3\_vtab\_distinct()](c3ref/vtab_distinct.html)
 interface that indicates a query that has both DISTINCT and ORDER BY
 clauses.
- Added the [sqlite3\_db\_name()](c3ref/db_name.html) interface.
- The unix os interface resolves all symbolic links in database
 filenames to create a canonical name for the database before the
 file is opened.
 If the [SQLITE\_OPEN\_NOFOLLOW](c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html) flag is used with [sqlite3\_open\_v2()](c3ref/open.html)
 or similar, the open will fail if any element of the path is a
 symbolic link.
- Defer materializing views until the materialization
 is actually needed, thus avoiding unnecessary work if the materialization turns
 out to never be used.
- The [HAVING clause](lang_select.html#resultset) of a [SELECT statement](lang_select.html) is now allowed on any aggregate query,
 even queries that do not have a [GROUP BY clause](lang_select.html#resultset).
- Many [microoptimizations](cpu.html#microopt) collectively reduce CPU cycles by about 2\.3%.
