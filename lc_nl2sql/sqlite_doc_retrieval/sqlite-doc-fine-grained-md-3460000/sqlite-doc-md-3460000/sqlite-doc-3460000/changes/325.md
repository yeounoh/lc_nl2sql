1. When doing DELETE and UPDATE, the library used to write the record
 numbers of records to be deleted or updated into a temporary file.
 This is changed so that the record numbers are held in memory.
2. The DELETE command without a WHILE clause just removes the database
 files from the disk, rather than going through and deleting record
 by record.
