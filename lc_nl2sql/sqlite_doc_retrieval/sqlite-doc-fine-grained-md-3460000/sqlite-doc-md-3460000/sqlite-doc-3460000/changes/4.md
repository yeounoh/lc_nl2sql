### 2024\-03\-12 (3\.45\.2\)

1. Fix an error in [UPSERT](lang_upsert.html), introduced by enhancement 3a in [version 3\.35\.0](#version_3_35_0)
 (2021\-03\-12\), that could cause an index to get out\-of\-sync with its table.

- Reduce the scope of the NOT NULL strength reduction optimization that was
 added as item 8e in [version 3\.35\.0](#version_3_35_0) (2021\-03\-12\). The optimization
 was being attempted in some contexts where it did not work, resulting in
 incorrect query results.
