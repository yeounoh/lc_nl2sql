### 2023\-03\-10 (3\.41\.1\)

1. Provide compile\-time options \-DHAVE\_LOG2\=0 and \-DHAVE\_LOG10\=0 to enable SQLite to be
 compiled on systems that omit the standard library functions log2() and log10(), repectively.
- Ensure that the datatype for column t1\.x in 
 "CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT CAST(7 AS INT) AS x;" continues to be INT and is not NUM,
 for historical compatibility.
- Enhance [PRAGMA integrity\_check](pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check) to detect when extra bytes appear at the end of an
 index record.
- Fix various obscure bugs reported by the user community. See the
 [timeline of changes](https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?from=version-3.41.0&to=version-3.41.1)
 for details.
