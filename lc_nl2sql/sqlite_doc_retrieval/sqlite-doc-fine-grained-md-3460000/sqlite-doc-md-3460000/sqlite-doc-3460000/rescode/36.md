### (28\) SQLITE\_WARNING



 The SQLITE\_WARNING result code is not returned by any C/C\+\+ interface.
 However, SQLITE\_WARNING (or rather one of its [extended error codes](rescode.html#extrc))
 is sometimes used as the first argument in an [sqlite3\_log()](c3ref/log.html) callback
 to indicate that an unusual and possibly ill\-advised operation is
 taking place.
