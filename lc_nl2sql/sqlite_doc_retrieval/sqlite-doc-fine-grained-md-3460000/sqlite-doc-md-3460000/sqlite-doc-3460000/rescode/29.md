### (21\) SQLITE\_MISUSE



 The SQLITE\_MISUSE return code might be returned if the application uses
 any SQLite interface in a way that is undefined or unsupported. For
 example, using a [prepared statement](c3ref/stmt.html) after that prepared statement has
 been [finalized](c3ref/finalize.html) might result in an SQLITE\_MISUSE error.
 
 SQLite tries to detect misuse and report the misuse using this result code.
 However, there is no guarantee that the detection of misuse will be
 successful. Misuse detection is probabilistic. Applications should
 never depend on an SQLITE\_MISUSE return value.
 
 If SQLite ever returns SQLITE\_MISUSE from any interface, that means that
 the application is incorrectly coded and needs to be fixed. Do not ship
 an application that sometimes returns SQLITE\_MISUSE from a standard
 SQLite interface because that application contains potentially serious bugs.
