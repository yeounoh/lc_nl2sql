# 2\. Primary Result Codes versus Extended Result Codes



Result codes are signed 32\-bit integers.
The least significant 8 bits of the result code define a broad category
and are called the "primary result code". More significant bits provide
more detailed information about the error and are called the
"extended result code"




Note that the primary result code is always a part of the extended
result code. Given a full 32\-bit extended result code, the application
can always find the corresponding primary result code merely by extracting
the least significant 8 bits of the extended result code.




All extended result codes are also error codes. Hence the terms
"extended result code" and "extended error code" are interchangeable.




For historic compatibility, the C\-language interfaces return
primary result codes by default. 
The extended result code for the most recent error can be
retrieved using the [sqlite3\_extended\_errcode()](c3ref/errcode.html) interface.
The [sqlite3\_extended\_result\_codes()](c3ref/extended_result_codes.html) interface can be used to put
a [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html) into a mode where it returns the
extended result codes instead of the primary result codes.
