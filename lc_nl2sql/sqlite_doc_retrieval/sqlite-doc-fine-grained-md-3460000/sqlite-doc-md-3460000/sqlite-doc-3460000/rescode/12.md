### (4\) SQLITE\_ABORT



 The SQLITE\_ABORT result code indicates that an operation was aborted
 prior to completion, usually be application request.
 See also: [SQLITE\_INTERRUPT](rescode.html#interrupt).
 
 If the callback function to [sqlite3\_exec()](c3ref/exec.html) returns non\-zero, then
 sqlite3\_exec() will return SQLITE\_ABORT.
 
 If a [ROLLBACK](lang_transaction.html) operation occurs on the same [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html) as
 a pending read or write, then the pending read or write may fail with
 an SQLITE\_ABORT or [SQLITE\_ABORT\_ROLLBACK](rescode.html#abort_rollback) error.
 
 In addition to being a result code,
 the SQLITE\_ABORT value is also used as a [conflict resolution mode](c3ref/c_fail.html)
 returned from the [sqlite3\_vtab\_on\_conflict()](c3ref/vtab_on_conflict.html) interface.
