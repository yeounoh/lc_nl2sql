### (27\) SQLITE\_NOTICE



 The SQLITE\_NOTICE result code is not returned by any C/C\+\+ interface.
 However, SQLITE\_NOTICE (or rather one of its [extended error codes](rescode.html#extrc))
 is sometimes used as the first argument in an [sqlite3\_log()](c3ref/log.html) callback
 to indicate that an unusual operation is taking place.
