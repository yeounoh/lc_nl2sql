### (1288\) SQLITE\_READONLY\_CANTINIT



 The SQLITE\_READONLY\_CANTINIT result code originates in the xShmMap method
 of a [VFS](vfs.html) to indicate that the shared memory region used by [WAL mode](wal.html)
 exists buts its content is unreliable and unusable by the current process
 since the current process does not have write permission on the shared
 memory region. (The shared memory region for WAL mode is normally a
 file with a "\-wal" suffix that is mmapped into the process space. If
 the current process does not have write permission on that file, then it
 cannot write into shared memory.)
 
 Higher level logic within SQLite will normally intercept the error code
 and create a temporary in\-memory shared memory region so that the current
 process can at least read the content of the database. This result code
 should not reach the application interface layer.
