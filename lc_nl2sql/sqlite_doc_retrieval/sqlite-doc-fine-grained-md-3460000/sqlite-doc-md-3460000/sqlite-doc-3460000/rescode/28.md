### (20\) SQLITE\_MISMATCH



 The SQLITE\_MISMATCH error code indicates a datatype mismatch.
 
 SQLite is normally very forgiving about mismatches between the type of
 a value and the declared type of the container in which that value is
 to be stored. For example, SQLite allows the application to store
 a large BLOB in a column with a declared type of BOOLEAN. But in a few
 cases, SQLite is strict about types. The SQLITE\_MISMATCH error is
 returned in those few cases when the types do not match.
 
 The [rowid](lang_createtable.html#rowid) of a table must be an integer. Attempt to set the [rowid](lang_createtable.html#rowid)
 to anything other than an integer (or a NULL which will be automatically
 converted into the next available integer rowid) results in an
 SQLITE\_MISMATCH error.
