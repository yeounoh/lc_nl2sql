### (778\) SQLITE\_IOERR\_WRITE



 The SQLITE\_IOERR\_WRITE error code is an [extended error code](rescode.html#pve)
 for [SQLITE\_IOERR](rescode.html#ioerr) indicating an I/O error in the [VFS](vfs.html) layer
 while trying to write into a file on disk. This error might result
 from a hardware malfunction or because a filesystem came unmounted
 while the file was open. This error should not occur if the filesystem
 is full as there is a separate error code (SQLITE\_FULL) for that purpose.
