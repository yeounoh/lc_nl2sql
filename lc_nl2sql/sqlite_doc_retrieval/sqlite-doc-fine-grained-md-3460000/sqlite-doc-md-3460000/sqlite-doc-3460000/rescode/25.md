### (17\) SQLITE\_SCHEMA



 The SQLITE\_SCHEMA result code indicates that the database schema
 has changed. This result code can be returned from [sqlite3\_step()](c3ref/step.html) for
 a [prepared statement](c3ref/stmt.html) that was generated using [sqlite3\_prepare()](c3ref/prepare.html) or
 [sqlite3\_prepare16()](c3ref/prepare.html). If the database schema was changed by some other
 process in between the time that the statement was prepared and the time
 the statement was run, this error can result.
 
 If a [prepared statement](c3ref/stmt.html) is generated from [sqlite3\_prepare\_v2()](c3ref/prepare.html) then
 the statement is automatically re\-prepared if the schema changes, up to
 [SQLITE\_MAX\_SCHEMA\_RETRY](compile.html#max_schema_retry) times (default: 50\). The [sqlite3\_step()](c3ref/step.html)
 interface will only return SQLITE\_SCHEMA back to the application if 
 the failure persists after these many retries.
