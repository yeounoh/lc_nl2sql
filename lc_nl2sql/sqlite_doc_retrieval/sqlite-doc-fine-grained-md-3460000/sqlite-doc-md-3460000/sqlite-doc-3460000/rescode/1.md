## Overview



Many of the routines in the SQLite [C\-language Interface](c3ref/intro.html) return
numeric result codes indicating either success or failure, and 
in the event of a failure, providing some idea of the cause of
the failure. This document strives to explain what each
of those numeric result codes means.
