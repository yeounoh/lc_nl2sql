### (769\) SQLITE\_ERROR\_SNAPSHOT



 The SQLITE\_ERROR\_SNAPSHOT result code might be returned when attempting
 to start a read transaction on an historical version of the database
 by using the [sqlite3\_snapshot\_open()](c3ref/snapshot_open.html) interface. If the historical
 snapshot is no longer available, then the read transaction will fail
 with the SQLITE\_ERROR\_SNAPSHOT. This error code is only possible if
 SQLite is compiled with [\-DSQLITE\_ENABLE\_SNAPSHOT](compile.html#enable_snapshot).
