### (10\) SQLITE\_IOERR



 The SQLITE\_IOERR result code says that the operation could not finish
 because the operating system reported an I/O error.
 
 A full disk drive will normally give an [SQLITE\_FULL](rescode.html#full) error rather than
 an SQLITE\_IOERR error.
 
 There are many different extended result codes for I/O errors that
 identify the specific I/O operation that failed.
