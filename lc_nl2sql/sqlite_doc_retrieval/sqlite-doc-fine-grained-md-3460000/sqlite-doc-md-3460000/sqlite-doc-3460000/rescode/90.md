### (3082\) SQLITE\_IOERR\_NOMEM



 The SQLITE\_IOERR\_NOMEM error code is sometimes returned by the [VFS](vfs.html)
 layer to indicate that an operation could not be completed due to the
 inability to allocate sufficient memory. This error code is normally
 converted into [SQLITE\_NOMEM](rescode.html#nomem) by the higher layers of SQLite before
 being returned to the application.
