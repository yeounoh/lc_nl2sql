### (256\) SQLITE\_OK\_LOAD\_PERMANENTLY



 The [sqlite3\_load\_extension()](c3ref/load_extension.html) interface loads an
 [extension](loadext.html) into a single
 database connection. The default behavior is for that extension to be
 automatically unloaded when the database connection closes. However,
 if the extension entry point returns SQLITE\_OK\_LOAD\_PERMANENTLY instead
 of SQLITE\_OK, then the extension remains loaded into the process address
 space after the database connection closes. In other words, the
 xDlClose methods of the [sqlite3\_vfs](c3ref/vfs.html) object is not called for the
 extension when the database connection closes.
 
 The SQLITE\_OK\_LOAD\_PERMANENTLY return code is useful to
 [loadable extensions](loadext.html) that register new [VFSes](vfs.html), for example.
