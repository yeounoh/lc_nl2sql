# 1\. Result Codes versus Error Codes



"Error codes" are a subset of "result codes" that indicate that
something has gone wrong. There are only a few non\-error result
codes: [SQLITE\_OK](rescode.html#ok), [SQLITE\_ROW](rescode.html#row), and [SQLITE\_DONE](rescode.html#done). The term
"error code" means any result code other than these three.
