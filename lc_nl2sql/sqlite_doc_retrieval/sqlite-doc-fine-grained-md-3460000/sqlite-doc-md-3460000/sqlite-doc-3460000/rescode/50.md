### (284\) SQLITE\_WARNING\_AUTOINDEX



 The SQLITE\_WARNING\_AUTOINDEX result code is
 passed to the callback of
 [sqlite3\_log()](c3ref/log.html) whenever [automatic indexing](optoverview.html#autoindex) is used.
 This can serve as a warning to application designers that the
 database might benefit from additional indexes.
