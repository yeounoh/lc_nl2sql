### (518\) SQLITE\_LOCKED\_VTAB



 The SQLITE\_LOCKED\_VTAB result code is not used by the SQLite core, but
 it is available for use by extensions. Virtual table implementations
 can return this result code to indicate that they cannot complete the
 current operation because of locks held by other threads or processes.
 
 The [R\-Tree extension](rtree.html) returns this result code when an attempt is made
 to update the R\-Tree while another prepared statement is actively reading
 the R\-Tree. The update cannot proceed because any change to an R\-Tree
 might involve reshuffling and rebalancing of nodes, which would disrupt
 read cursors, causing some rows to be repeated and other rows to be
 omitted.
