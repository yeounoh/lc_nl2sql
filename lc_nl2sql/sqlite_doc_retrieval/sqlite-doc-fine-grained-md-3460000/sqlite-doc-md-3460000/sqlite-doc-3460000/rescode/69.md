### (1034\) SQLITE\_IOERR\_FSYNC



 The SQLITE\_IOERR\_FSYNC error code is an [extended error code](rescode.html#pve)
 for [SQLITE\_IOERR](rescode.html#ioerr) indicating an I/O error in the [VFS](vfs.html) layer
 while trying to flush previously written content out of OS and/or
 disk\-control buffers and into persistent storage. In other words,
 this code indicates a problem with the fsync() system call in unix
 or the FlushFileBuffers() system call in windows.
