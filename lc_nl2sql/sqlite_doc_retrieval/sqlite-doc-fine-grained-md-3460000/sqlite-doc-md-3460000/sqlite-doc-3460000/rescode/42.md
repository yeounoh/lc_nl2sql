### (262\) SQLITE\_LOCKED\_SHAREDCACHE



 The SQLITE\_LOCKED\_SHAREDCACHE result code indicates that access to
 an SQLite data record is blocked by another database connection that
 is using the same record in [shared cache mode](sharedcache.html). When two or more
 database connections share the same cache and one of the connections is
 in the middle of modifying a record in that cache, then other connections
 are blocked from accessing that data while the modifications are on\-going
 in order to prevent the readers from seeing a corrupt or partially
 completed change.
