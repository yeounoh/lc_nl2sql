### (7\) SQLITE\_NOMEM



 The SQLITE\_NOMEM result code indicates that SQLite was unable to allocate
 all the memory it needed to complete the operation. In other words, an
 internal call to [sqlite3\_malloc()](c3ref/free.html) or [sqlite3\_realloc()](c3ref/free.html) has failed in
 a case where the memory being allocated was required in order to continue
 the operation.
