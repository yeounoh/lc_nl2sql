### (2\) SQLITE\_INTERNAL



 The SQLITE\_INTERNAL result code indicates an internal malfunction.
 In a working version of SQLite, an application should never see this
 result code. If application does encounter this result code, it shows
 that there is a bug in the database engine.
 
 SQLite does not currently generate this result code.
 However, [application\-defined SQL functions](appfunc.html) or
 [virtual tables](vtab.html), or [VFSes](vfs.html), or other extensions might cause this 
 result code to be returned.
