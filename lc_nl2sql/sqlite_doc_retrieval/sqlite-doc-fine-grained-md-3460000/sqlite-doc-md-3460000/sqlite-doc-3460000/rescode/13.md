### (5\) SQLITE\_BUSY



 The SQLITE\_BUSY result code indicates that the database file could not
 be written (or in some cases read) because of concurrent activity by 
 some other [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html), usually a database connection in a
 separate process.
 
 For example, if process A is in the middle of a large write transaction
 and at the same time process B attempts to start a new write transaction,
 process B will get back an SQLITE\_BUSY result because SQLite only supports
 one writer at a time. Process B will need to wait for process A to finish
 its transaction before starting a new transaction. The
 [sqlite3\_busy\_timeout()](c3ref/busy_timeout.html) and [sqlite3\_busy\_handler()](c3ref/busy_handler.html) interfaces and
 the [busy\_timeout pragma](pragma.html#pragma_busy_timeout) are available to process B to help it deal
 with SQLITE\_BUSY errors.
 
 An SQLITE\_BUSY error can occur at any point in a transaction: when the
 transaction is first started, during any write or update operations, or
 when the transaction commits.
 To avoid encountering SQLITE\_BUSY errors in the middle of a transaction,
 the application can use [BEGIN IMMEDIATE](lang_transaction.html#immediate) instead of just [BEGIN](lang_transaction.html) to
 start a transaction. The [BEGIN IMMEDIATE](lang_transaction.html#immediate) command might itself return
 SQLITE\_BUSY, but if it succeeds, then SQLite guarantees that no 
 subsequent operations on the same database through the next [COMMIT](lang_transaction.html) 
 will return SQLITE\_BUSY.
 
 See also: [SQLITE\_BUSY\_RECOVERY](rescode.html#busy_recovery) and [SQLITE\_BUSY\_SNAPSHOT](rescode.html#busy_snapshot).
 
 The SQLITE\_BUSY result code differs from [SQLITE\_LOCKED](rescode.html#locked) in that
 SQLITE\_BUSY indicates a conflict with a
 separate [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html), probably in a separate process,
 whereas [SQLITE\_LOCKED](rescode.html#locked) 
 indicates a conflict within the same [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html) (or sometimes
 a database connection with a [shared cache](sharedcache.html)).
