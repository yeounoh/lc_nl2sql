### (1032\) SQLITE\_READONLY\_DBMOVED



 The SQLITE\_READONLY\_DBMOVED error code is an [extended error code](rescode.html#pve)
 for [SQLITE\_READONLY](rescode.html#readonly). The SQLITE\_READONLY\_DBMOVED error code indicates
 that a database cannot be modified because the database file has been
 moved since it was opened, and so any attempt to modify the database
 might result in database corruption if the processes crashes because the
 [rollback journal](lockingv3.html#rollback) would not be correctly named.
