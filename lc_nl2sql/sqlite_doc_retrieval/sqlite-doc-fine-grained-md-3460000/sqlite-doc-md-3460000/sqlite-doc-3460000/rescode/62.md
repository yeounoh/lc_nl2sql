### (773\) SQLITE\_BUSY\_TIMEOUT



 The SQLITE\_BUSY\_TIMEOUT error code indicates that a blocking Posix
 advisory file lock request in the VFS layer failed due to a timeout.
 Blocking Posix advisory locks are only
 available as a proprietary SQLite extension and even then are only
 supported if SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE\_EANBLE\_SETLK\_TIMEOUT
 compile\-time option.
