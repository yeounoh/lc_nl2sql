### (531\) SQLITE\_CONSTRAINT\_COMMITHOOK



 The SQLITE\_CONSTRAINT\_COMMITHOOK error code
 is an [extended error code](rescode.html#pve)
 for [SQLITE\_CONSTRAINT](rescode.html#constraint) indicating that a
 [commit hook callback](c3ref/commit_hook.html) returned non\-zero that thus
 caused the SQL statement to be rolled back.
