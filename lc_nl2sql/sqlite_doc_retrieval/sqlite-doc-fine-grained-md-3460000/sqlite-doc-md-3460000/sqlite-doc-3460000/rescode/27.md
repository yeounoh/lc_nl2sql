### (19\) SQLITE\_CONSTRAINT



 The SQLITE\_CONSTRAINT error code means that an SQL constraint violation
 occurred while trying to process an SQL statement. Additional information
 about the failed constraint can be found by consulting the
 accompanying error message (returned via [sqlite3\_errmsg()](c3ref/errcode.html) or
 [sqlite3\_errmsg16()](c3ref/errcode.html)) or by looking at the [extended error code](rescode.html#extrc).
 
 The SQLITE\_CONSTRAINT code can also be used as the return value from
 the [xBestIndex()](vtab.html#xbestindex) method of a [virtual table](vtab.html) implementation. When
 xBestIndex() returns SQLITE\_CONSTRAINT, that indicates that the particular
 combination of inputs submitted to xBestIndex() cannot result in a
 usable query plan and should not be given further consideration.
