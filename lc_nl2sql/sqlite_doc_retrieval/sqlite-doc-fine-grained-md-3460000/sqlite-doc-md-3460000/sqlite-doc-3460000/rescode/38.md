### (101\) SQLITE\_DONE



 The SQLITE\_DONE result code indicates that an operation has completed.
 The SQLITE\_DONE result code is most commonly seen as a return value
 from [sqlite3\_step()](c3ref/step.html) indicating that the SQL statement has run to
 completion. But SQLITE\_DONE can also be returned by other multi\-step
 interfaces such as [sqlite3\_backup\_step()](c3ref/backup_finish.html#sqlite3backupstep).
