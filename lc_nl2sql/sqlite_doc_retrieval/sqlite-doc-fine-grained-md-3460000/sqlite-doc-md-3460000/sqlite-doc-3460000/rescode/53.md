### (517\) SQLITE\_BUSY\_SNAPSHOT



 The SQLITE\_BUSY\_SNAPSHOT error code is an [extended error code](rescode.html#pve)
 for [SQLITE\_BUSY](rescode.html#busy) that occurs on [WAL mode](wal.html) databases when a database
 connection tries to promote a read transaction into a write transaction
 but finds that another [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html) has already written to the
 database and thus invalidated prior reads.
 
 The following scenario illustrates how an SQLITE\_BUSY\_SNAPSHOT error
 might arise:
 1. Process A starts a read transaction on the database and does one
 or more SELECT statement. Process A keeps the transaction open.
 - Process B updates the database, changing values previous read by
 process A.
 - Process A now tries to write to the database. But process A's view
 of the database content is now obsolete because process B has
 modified the database file after process A read from it. Hence
 process A gets an SQLITE\_BUSY\_SNAPSHOT error.
