### (257\) SQLITE\_ERROR\_MISSING\_COLLSEQ



 The SQLITE\_ERROR\_MISSING\_COLLSEQ result code means that an SQL
 statement could not be prepared because a collating sequence named
 in that SQL statement could not be located.
 
 Sometimes when this error code is encountered, the
 [sqlite3\_prepare\_v2()](c3ref/prepare.html) routine will convert the error into
 [SQLITE\_ERROR\_RETRY](rescode.html#error_retry) and try again to prepare the SQL statement
 using a different query plan that does not require the use of
 the unknown collating sequence.
