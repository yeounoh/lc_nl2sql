### (779\) SQLITE\_CORRUPT\_INDEX



 The SQLITE\_CORRUPT\_INDEX result code means that SQLite detected
 an entry is or was missing from an index. This is a special case of
 the [SQLITE\_CORRUPT](rescode.html#corrupt) error code that suggests that the problem might
 be resolved by running the [REINDEX](lang_reindex.html) command, assuming no other
 problems exist elsewhere in the database file.
