### (8458\) SQLITE\_IOERR\_CORRUPTFS



 The SQLITE\_IOERR\_CORRUPTFS error code is an [extended error code](rescode.html#pve)
 for [SQLITE\_IOERR](rescode.html#ioerr) used only by a VFS to indicate that a seek or read
 failure was due to the request not falling within the file's boundary
 rather than an ordinary device failure. This often indicates a
 corrupt filesystem.
