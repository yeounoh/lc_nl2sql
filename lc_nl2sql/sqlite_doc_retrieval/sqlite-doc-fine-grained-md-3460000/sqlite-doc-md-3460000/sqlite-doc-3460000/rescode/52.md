### (516\) SQLITE\_ABORT\_ROLLBACK



 The SQLITE\_ABORT\_ROLLBACK error code is an [extended error code](rescode.html#pve)
 for [SQLITE\_ABORT](rescode.html#abort) indicating that an SQL statement aborted because
 the transaction that was active when the SQL statement first started
 was rolled back. Pending write operations always fail with this error
 when a rollback occurs. A [ROLLBACK](lang_transaction.html) will cause a pending read operation
 to fail only if the schema was changed within the transaction being rolled
 back.
