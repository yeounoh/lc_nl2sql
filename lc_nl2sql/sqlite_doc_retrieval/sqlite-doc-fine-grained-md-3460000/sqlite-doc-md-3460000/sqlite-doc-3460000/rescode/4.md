# 3\. Definitions



All result codes are integers.
Symbolic names for all result codes are created using
"\#define" macros in the sqlite3\.h header file.
There are separate sections in the sqlite3\.h header file for
the [result code definitions](c3ref/c_abort.html) and the [extended result code definitions](c3ref/c_abort_rollback.html).




Primary result code symbolic names are of the form "SQLITE\_XXXXXX" where
XXXXXX is a sequence of uppercase alphabetic characters. Extended
result code names are of the form "SQLITE\_XXXXXX\_YYYYYYY" where
the XXXXXX part is the corresponding primary result code and the
YYYYYYY is an extension that further classifies the result code.




The names and numeric values for existing result codes are fixed
and unchanging. However, new result codes, and especially new extended
result codes, might appear in future releases of SQLite.
