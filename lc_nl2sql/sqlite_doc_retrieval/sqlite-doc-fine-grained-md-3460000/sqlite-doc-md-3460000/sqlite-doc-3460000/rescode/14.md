### (6\) SQLITE\_LOCKED



 The SQLITE\_LOCKED result code indicates that a write operation could not
 continue because of a conflict within the same [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html) or
 a conflict with a different database connection that uses a [shared cache](sharedcache.html).
 
 For example, a [DROP TABLE](lang_droptable.html) statement cannot be run while another thread
 is reading from that table on the same [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html) because 
 dropping the table would delete the table out from under the concurrent
 reader.
 
 The SQLITE\_LOCKED result code differs from [SQLITE\_BUSY](rescode.html#busy) in that
 SQLITE\_LOCKED indicates a conflict on the same [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html)
 (or on a connection with a [shared cache](sharedcache.html)) whereas [SQLITE\_BUSY](rescode.html#busy) indicates
 a conflict with a different database connection, probably in a different
 process.
