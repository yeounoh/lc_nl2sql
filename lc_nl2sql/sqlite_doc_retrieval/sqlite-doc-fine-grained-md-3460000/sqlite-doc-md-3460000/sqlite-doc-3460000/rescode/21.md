### (13\) SQLITE\_FULL



 The SQLITE\_FULL result code indicates that a write could not complete
 because the disk is full. Note that this error can occur when trying
 to write information into the main database file, or it can also
 occur when writing into [temporary disk files](tempfiles.html).
 
 Sometimes applications encounter this error even though there is an
 abundance of primary disk space because the error occurs when writing
 into [temporary disk files](tempfiles.html) on a system where temporary files are stored
 on a separate partition with much less space that the primary disk.
