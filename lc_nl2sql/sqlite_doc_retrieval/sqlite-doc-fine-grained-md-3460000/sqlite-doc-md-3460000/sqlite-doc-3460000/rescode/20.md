### (12\) SQLITE\_NOTFOUND



 The SQLITE\_NOTFOUND result code is exposed in three ways:
 1. SQLITE\_NOTFOUND can be returned by the [sqlite3\_file\_control()](c3ref/file_control.html) interface
 to indicate that the [file control opcode](c3ref/c_fcntl_begin_atomic_write.html) passed as the third argument
 was not recognized by the underlying [VFS](vfs.html).
 - SQLITE\_NOTFOUND can also be returned by the xSetSystemCall() method of
 an [sqlite3\_vfs](c3ref/vfs.html) object.
 - SQLITE\_NOTFOUND can be returned by [sqlite3\_vtab\_rhs\_value()](c3ref/vtab_rhs_value.html) to indicate
 that the right\-hand operand of a constraint is not available to the
 [xBestIndex method](vtab.html#xbestindex) that made the call.



 The SQLITE\_NOTFOUND result code is also used
 internally by the SQLite implementation, but those internal uses are
 not exposed to the application.
