## 7\.3\. The "integrity\-check" command



 The "integrity\-check" command causes SQLite to read and verify
 the accuracy of all inverted indices in an FTS3/4 table by comparing
 those inverted indices against the original content. The
 "integrity\-check" command silently succeeds if the inverted
 indices are all ok, but will fail with an SQLITE\_CORRUPT error
 if any problems are found.




 The "integrity\-check" command is similar in concept to
 [PRAGMA integrity\_check](pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check). In a working system, the "integrity\-command"
 should always be successful. Possible causes of integrity\-check
 failures include:
 

* The application has made changes to the [FTS shadow tables](fts3.html#*shadowtab)
 directly, without using the FTS3/4 virtual table, causing
 the shadow tables to become out of sync with each other.
* Using the [FTS4 content option](fts3.html#*fts4content) and failing to manually keep
 the content in sync with the FTS4 inverted indices.
* Bugs in the FTS3/4 virtual table. (The "integrity\-check"
 command was original conceived as part of the test suite
 for FTS3/4\.)
* Corruption to the underlying SQLite database file. (See
 documentation on [how to corrupt](howtocorrupt.html) and SQLite database for
 additional information.)
