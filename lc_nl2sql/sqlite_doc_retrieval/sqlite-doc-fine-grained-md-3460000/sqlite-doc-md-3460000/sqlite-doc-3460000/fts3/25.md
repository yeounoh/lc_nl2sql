## 6\.6\. The prefix\= option



 The FTS4 prefix option causes FTS to index term prefixes of specified lengths
 in the same way that it always indexes complete terms. The prefix option
 must be set to a comma separated list of positive non\-zero integers.
 For each value N in the list, prefixes of length N bytes (when encoded
 using UTF\-8\) are indexed. FTS4 uses term prefix indexes to speed up
 [prefix queries](fts3.html#termprefix). The cost, of course, is that indexing term prefixes as
 well as complete terms increases the database size and slows down write
 operations on the FTS4 table.




 Prefix indexes may be used to optimize [prefix queries](fts3.html#termprefix) in two cases.
 If the query is for a prefix of N bytes, then a prefix index created
 with "prefix\=N" provides the best optimization. Or, if no "prefix\=N"
 index is available, a "prefix\=N\+1" index may be used instead.
 Using a "prefix\=N\+1" index is less
 efficient than a "prefix\=N" index, but is better than no prefix index at all.




```
-- Create an FTS4 table with indexes to optimize 2 and 4 byte prefix queries.
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t1 USING fts4(c1, c2, prefix="2,4");

-- The following two queries are both optimized using the prefix indexes.
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1 MATCH 'ab*';
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1 MATCH 'abcd*';

-- The following two queries are both partially optimized using the prefix
-- indexes. The optimization is not as pronounced as it is for the queries
-- above, but still an improvement over no prefix indexes at all.
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1 MATCH 'a*';
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1 MATCH 'abc*';

```
