# 6\. FTS4 Options



 If the "CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE" statement specifies module FTS4 (not FTS3\),
 then special directives \- FTS4 options \- similar to the "tokenize\=\*" option
 may also appear in place of column names. An FTS4 option consists of the
 option name, followed by an "\=" character, followed by the option value.
 The option value may optionally be enclosed in single or double quotes, with
 embedded quote characters escaped in the same way as for SQL literals. There
 may not be whitespace on either side of the "\=" character. For example,
 to create an FTS4 table with the value of option "matchinfo" set to "fts3":




```
-- Create a reduced-footprint FTS4 table.
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE papers USING fts4(author, document, matchinfo=fts3);

```


 FTS4 currently supports the following options:





| Option | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| compress | The compress option is used to specify the compress function. It is an error to  specify a compress function without also specifying an uncompress  function. [See below](fts3.html#the_compress_and_uncompress_options) for details. |
| content | The content allows the text being indexed to be  stored in a separate table distinct from the FTS4 table,  or even outside of SQLite. |
| languageid | The languageid option causes the FTS4 table to have an additional hidden  integer column that identifies the language of the text contained in  each row. The use of the languageid option allows the same FTS4 table  to hold text in multiple languages or scripts, each with different tokenizer  rules, and to query each language independently of the others. |
| matchinfo | When set to the value "fts3", the matchinfo option reduces the amount of  information stored by FTS4 with the consequence that the "l" option of  [matchinfo()](fts3.html#matchinfo) is no longer available. |
| notindexed | This option is used to specify the name of a column for which data is  not indexed. Values stored in columns that are not indexed are not  matched by MATCH queries. Nor are they recognized by auxiliary functions.  A single CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement may have any number of notindexed  options. |
| order | The "order" option may be set to either "DESC" or "ASC" (in upper or  lower case). If it is set to "DESC", then FTS4 stores its data in such  a way as to optimize returning results in descending order by docid.  If it is set to "ASC" (the default), then the data structures are  optimized for returning results in ascending order by docid. In other  words, if many of the queries run against the FTS4 table use "ORDER BY  docid DESC", then it may improve performance to add the "order\=desc"  option to the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement. |
| prefix | This option may be set to a comma\-separated list of positive non\-zero  integers. For each integer N in the list, a separate index is created  in the database file to optimize [prefix queries](fts3.html#termprefix) where  the query term is N bytes in length, not including the '\*' character,  when encoded using UTF\-8\. [See below](fts3.html#the_prefix_option) for details. |
| uncompress | This option is used to specify the uncompress function. It is an error to  specify an uncompress function without also specifying a compress  function. [See below](fts3.html#the_compress_and_uncompress_options) for details. |



 When using FTS4, specifying a column name that contains an "\=" character
 and is not either a "tokenize\=\*" specification or a recognized FTS4 option
 is an error. With FTS3, the first token in the unrecognized directive is
 interpreted as a column name. Similarly, specifying multiple "tokenize\=\*"
 directives in a single table declaration is an error when using FTS4, whereas
 the second and subsequent "tokenize\=\*" directives are interpreted as column
 names by FTS3\. For example:




```
-- An error. FTS4 does not recognize the directive "xyz=abc".
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE papers USING fts4(author, document, xyz=abc);

-- Create an FTS3 table with three columns - "author", "document"
-- and "xyz".
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE papers USING fts3(author, document, xyz=abc);

-- An error. FTS4 does not allow multiple tokenize=* directives
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE papers USING fts4(tokenize=porter, tokenize=simple);

-- Create an FTS3 table with a single column named "tokenize". The
-- table uses the "porter" tokenizer.
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE papers USING fts3(tokenize=porter, tokenize=simple);

-- An error. Cannot create a table with two columns named "tokenize".
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE papers USING fts3(tokenize=porter, tokenize=simple, tokenize=icu);

```
