## Overview



 FTS3 and FTS4 are SQLite virtual table modules that allows users to perform
 full\-text searches on a set of documents. The most common (and effective)
 way to describe full\-text searches is "what Google, Yahoo, and Bing do
 with documents placed on the World Wide Web". Users input a term, or series
 of terms, perhaps connected by a binary operator or grouped together into a
 phrase, and the full\-text query system finds the set of documents that best
 matches those terms considering the operators and groupings the user has
 specified. This article describes the deployment and usage of FTS3 and FTS4\.




 FTS1 and FTS2 are obsolete full\-text search modules for SQLite. There are known
 issues with these older modules and their use should be avoided.
 Portions of the original FTS3 code were contributed to the SQLite project
 by Scott Hess of [Google](http://www.google.com). It is now
 developed and maintained as part of SQLite.
