# 7\. Special Commands For FTS3 and FTS4



 Special INSERT operates can be used to issue commands to FTS3 and FTS4 tables.
 Every FTS3 and FTS4 has a hidden, read\-only column which is the same name as
 the table itself. INSERTs into this hidden column are interpreted as commands
 to the FTS3/4 table. For a table with the name "xyz" the following commands
 are supported:



* INSERT INTO xyz(xyz) VALUES('optimize');
* INSERT INTO xyz(xyz) VALUES('rebuild');
* INSERT INTO xyz(xyz) VALUES('integrity\-check');
* INSERT INTO xyz(xyz) VALUES('merge\=X,Y');
* INSERT INTO xyz(xyz) VALUES('automerge\=N');
