## 6\.5\. The notindexed\= option



 Normally, the FTS module maintains an inverted index of all terms in
 all columns of the table. This option is used to specify the name of
 a column for which entries should not be added to the index. Multiple
 "notindexed" options may be used to specify that multiple columns should
 be omitted from the index. For example:




```
-- Create an FTS4 table for which only the contents of columns c2 and c4
-- are tokenized and added to the inverted index.
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t1 USING fts4(c1, c2, c3, c4, notindexed=c1, notindexed=c3);

```


 Values stored in unindexed columns are not eligible to match MATCH
 operators. They do not influence the results of the offsets() or matchinfo()
 auxiliary functions. Nor will the snippet() function ever return a
 snippet based on a value stored in an unindexed column.
