## 4\.1\. The Offsets Function



 For a SELECT query that uses the full\-text index, the offsets() function
 returns a text value containing a series of space\-separated integers. For
 each term in each [phrase match](#matchable) of the current row,
 there are four integers in the returned list. Each set of four integers is
 interpreted as follows:





| Integer | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | The column number that the term instance occurs in (0 for the  leftmost column of the FTS table, 1 for the next leftmost, etc.). |
| 1 | The term number of the matching term within the full\-text query  expression. Terms within a query expression are numbered starting  from 0 in the order that they occur. |
| 2 | The byte offset of the matching term within the column. |
| 3 | The size of the matching term in bytes. |



 The following block contains examples that use the offsets function.




```
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE mail USING fts3(subject, body);
INSERT INTO mail VALUES('hello world', 'This message is a hello world message.');
INSERT INTO mail VALUES('urgent: serious', 'This mail is seen as a more serious mail');

-- The following query returns a single row (as it matches only the first
-- entry in table "mail". The text returned by the offsets function is
-- "0 0 6 5 1 0 24 5".
--
-- The first set of four integers in the result indicate that column 0
-- contains an instance of term 0 ("world") at byte offset 6. The term instance
-- is 5 bytes in size. The second set of four integers shows that column 1
-- of the matched row contains an instance of term 0 ("world") at byte offset
-- 24. Again, the term instance is 5 bytes in size.
SELECT offsets(mail) FROM mail WHERE mail MATCH 'world';

-- The following query returns also matches only the first row in table "mail".
-- In this case the returned text is "1 0 5 7 1 0 30 7".
SELECT offsets(mail) FROM mail WHERE mail MATCH 'message';

-- The following query matches the second row in table "mail". It returns the
-- text "1 0 28 7 1 1 36 4". Only those occurrences of terms "serious" and "mail"
-- that are part of an instance of the phrase "serious mail" are identified; the
-- other occurrences of "serious" and "mail" are ignored.
SELECT offsets(mail) FROM mail WHERE mail MATCH '"serious mail"';

```
