## 3\.2\. Set Operations Using The Standard Query Syntax



 FTS query set operations using the standard query syntax are similar, but
 not identical, to set operations with the enhanced query syntax. There
 are four differences, as follows:



1. Only the implicit version of the AND operator is supported.
 Specifying the string "AND" as part of a standard query syntax query is
 interpreted as a term query for the set of documents containing the term
 "and".


1. Parenthesis are not supported.


1. The NOT operator is not supported. Instead of the NOT
 operator, the standard query syntax supports a unary "\-" operator that
 may be applied to basic term and term\-prefix queries (but not to phrase
 or NEAR queries). A term or term\-prefix that has a unary "\-" operator
 attached to it may not appear as an operand to an OR operator. An FTS
 query may not consist entirely of terms or term\-prefix queries with unary
 "\-" operators attached to them.



```
-- Search for the set of documents that contain the term "sqlite" but do
-- not contain the term "database".
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'sqlite -database';

```

1. The relative precedence of the set operations is different.
 In particular, using the standard query syntax the "OR" operator has a
 higher precedence than "AND". The precedence of operators when using the
 standard query syntax is:




| Operator | Standard Query Syntax Precedence |
| --- | --- |
| Unary "\-" | Highest precedence (tightest grouping). |
| OR |  |
| AND | Lowest precedence (loosest grouping). |


1. The following example illustrates precedence of operators using the standard
 query syntax:



```
-- Search for documents that contain at least one of the terms "database"
-- and "sqlite", and also contain the term "library". Because of the differences
-- in operator precedences, this query would have a different interpretation using
-- the enhanced query syntax.
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'sqlite OR database library';

```
