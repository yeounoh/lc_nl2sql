## 6\.2\. The content\= option



 The content option allows FTS4 to forego storing the text being indexed.
 The content option can be used in two ways:



* The indexed documents are not stored within the SQLite database
 at all (a "contentless" FTS4 table), or
* The indexed documents are stored in a database table created and
 managed by the user (an "external content" FTS4 table).



 Because the indexed documents themselves are usually much larger than
 the full\-text index, the content option can be used to achieve
 significant space savings.
