## 7\.2\. The "rebuild" command



 The "rebuild" command causes SQLite to discard the entire FTS3/4
 table and then rebuild it again from original text. The concept
 is similar to [REINDEX](lang_reindex.html), only that it applies to an
 FTS3/4 table instead of an ordinary index.




 The "rebuild" command should be run whenever the implementation
 of a custom tokenizer changes, so that all content can be retokenized.
 The "rebuild" command is also useful when using the
 [FTS4 content option](fts3.html#*fts4content) after changes have been made to the original
 content table.
