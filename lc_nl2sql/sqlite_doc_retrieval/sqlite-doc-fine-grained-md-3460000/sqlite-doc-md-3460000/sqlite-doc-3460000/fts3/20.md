### 6\.2\.1\.  Contentless FTS4 Tables



 In order to create an FTS4 table that does not store a copy of the indexed
 documents at all, the content option should be set to an empty string.
 For example, the following SQL creates such an FTS4 table with three
 columns \- "a", "b", and "c":




```
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t1 USING fts4(content="", a, b, c);

```


 Data can be inserted into such an FTS4 table using an INSERT statements.
 However, unlike ordinary FTS4 tables, the user must supply an explicit
 integer docid value. For example:




```
-- This statement is Ok:
INSERT INTO t1(docid, a, b, c) VALUES(1, 'a b c', 'd e f', 'g h i');

-- This statement causes an error, as no docid value has been provided:
INSERT INTO t1(a, b, c) VALUES('j k l', 'm n o', 'p q r');

```


 It is not possible to UPDATE or DELETE a row stored in a contentless FTS4
 table. Attempting to do so is an error.




 Contentless FTS4 tables also support SELECT statements. However, it is
 an error to attempt to retrieve the value of any table column other than
 the docid column. The auxiliary function matchinfo() may be used, but
 snippet() and offsets() may not. For example:




```
-- The following statements are Ok:
SELECT docid FROM t1 WHERE t1 MATCH 'xxx';
SELECT docid FROM t1 WHERE a MATCH 'xxx';
SELECT matchinfo(t1) FROM t1 WHERE t1 MATCH 'xxx';

-- The following statements all cause errors, as the value of columns
-- other than docid are required to evaluate them.
SELECT * FROM t1;
SELECT a, b FROM t1 WHERE t1 MATCH 'xxx';
SELECT docid FROM t1 WHERE a LIKE 'xxx%';
SELECT snippet(t1) FROM t1 WHERE t1 MATCH 'xxx';

```


 Errors related to attempting to retrieve column values other than docid
 are runtime errors that occur within sqlite3\_step(). In some cases, for
 example if the MATCH expression in a SELECT query matches zero rows, there
 may be no error at all even if a statement does refer to column values
 other than docid.
