## 6\.4\. The matchinfo\= option



 The matchinfo option may only be set to the value "fts3".
 Attempting to set matchinfo to anything other than "fts3" is an error.
 If this option is specified, then some of the extra information stored by
 FTS4 is omitted. This reduces the amount of disk space consumed by
 an FTS4 table until it is almost the same as the amount that would
 be used by the equivalent FTS3 table, but also means that the data
 accessed by passing the 'l' flag to the [matchinfo()](fts3.html#matchinfo) function is
 not available.
