# 3\. Using Zipfile


The zipfile module provides three similar interfaces for accessing, updating
and creating zip file archives:



1. A table\-valued function, which provides read\-only access to existing
 archives, either from the file\-system or in\-memory.
2. A virtual table, which provides read and write access to archives
 stored in the file\-system.
3. An SQL aggregate function, which can be used to create new archives
 in memory.

archives. A table\-valued function, which provides read\-only access to
existing archives, and a virtual table interface, which provides both
