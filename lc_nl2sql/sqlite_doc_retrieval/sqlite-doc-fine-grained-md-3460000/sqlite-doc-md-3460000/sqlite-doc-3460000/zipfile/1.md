# 1\. Overview


 The zipfile module provides read/write access to simple 
[ZIP archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_%28file_format%29).
The current implementation has the following restrictions:



* Does not support encryption.
* Does not support ZIP archives that span multiple files.
* Does not support zip64 extensions.
* The only compression algorithm supported is
 ["deflate"](https://zlib.net).


 Some or all of these restrictions may be removed in the future.
