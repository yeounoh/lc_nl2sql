## 3\.2\. Virtual Table Interface (read/write access)


In order to create or modify an existing zip file, a "zipfile" virtual 
table must be created in the database schema. The CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE
statement expects a path to the zip file as its only argument. For example, to
write to zip file "test.zip" in the current directory, a zipfile table may be
created using:




```
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE temp.zip USING zipfile('test.zip');

```

Such a virtual table has the same columns as the table\-valued function
described in the previous section. It may be read from using a SELECT 
statement in the same way as the table\-valued function can. 



Using the virtual table interface, new entries may be added to a zip
archive by inserting new rows into the virtual table. Entries may be
removed by deleting rows or modified by updating them.
