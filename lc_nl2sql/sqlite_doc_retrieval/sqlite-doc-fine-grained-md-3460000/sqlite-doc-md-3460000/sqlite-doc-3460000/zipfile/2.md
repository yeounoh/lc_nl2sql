# 2\. Obtaining and Compiling Zipfile


The code for the zipfile module is found in the 
[ext/misc/zipfile.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/zipfile.c)
file of the
[main SQLite source tree](https://sqlite.org/src).
It may be compiled into an SQLite 
[loadable extension](loadext.html) using a command like:




```
gcc -g -fPIC -shared zipfile.c -o zipfile.so

```

Alternatively, the zipfile.c file may be compiled into the application. 
In this case, the following function should be invoked to register the
extension with each new database connection:




```
int sqlite3_zipfile_init(sqlite3 *db, void*, void*);

```

 The first argument passed should be the database handle to register the
extension with. The second and third arguments should both be passed 0\.



 Zipfile is included in most builds of the [command\-line shell](cli.html).
