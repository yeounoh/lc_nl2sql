### 3\.2\.3\.  Updating Existing Zip Archive Entries


Existing zip archive entries may be modified using UPDATE statements.



The three leftmost columns of a zipfile virtual table, "name", "mode" 
and "mtime", may each be set to any value that may be inserted into the same
column (see above). If either "mode" or "mtime" is set to NULL, the final 
value is determined as described for an INSERT of a NULL value \- the current
time for "mtime" and either 33188 or 16877 for "mode", depending on whether 
or not the values specified for the next four columns of the zipfile table
indicate that the entry is a directory or a file.



It is an error to attempt to set the sz or rawdata field to any value
other than NULL. 



The data and method columns may also be set as described for an INSERT
above.
