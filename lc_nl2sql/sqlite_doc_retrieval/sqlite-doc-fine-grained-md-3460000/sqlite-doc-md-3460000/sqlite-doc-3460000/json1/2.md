# 2\. Compiling in JSON Support



The JSON functions and operators are built into SQLite by default,
as of SQLite version 3\.38\.0 (2022\-02\-22\). They can be omitted
by adding the \-DSQLITE\_OMIT\_JSON compile\-time option. Prior to
version 3\.38\.0, the JSON functions were an extension that would only
be included in builds if the \-DSQLITE\_ENABLE\_JSON1 compile\-time option
was included. In other words, the JSON functions went from being
opt\-in with SQLite version 3\.37\.2 and earlier to opt\-out with
SQLite version 3\.38\.0 and later.
