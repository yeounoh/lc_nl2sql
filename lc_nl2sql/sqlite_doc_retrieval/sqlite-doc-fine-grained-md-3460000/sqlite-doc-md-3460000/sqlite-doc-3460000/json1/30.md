## 4\.16\. The json\_pretty() function



The json\_pretty() function works like [json()](json1.html#jmini) except that it adds
extra whitespace to make the JSON result easier for humans to read.
The first argument is the JSON or JSONB that is to be pretty\-printed.
The optional second argument is a text string that is used for indentation.
If the second argument is omitted or is NULL, then indentation is four
spaces per level.



The json\_pretty() function was added with SQLite version 3\.46\.0 
(2024\-05\-23\).
