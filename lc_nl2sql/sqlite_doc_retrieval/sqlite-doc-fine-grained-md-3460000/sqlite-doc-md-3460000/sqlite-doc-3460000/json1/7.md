### 3\.2\.2\. Handling of malformed JSONB



The JSONB that is generated by SQLite will always be well\-formed. If you
follow recommended practice and
treat JSONB as an opaque BLOB, then you will not have any problems. But
JSONB is just a BLOB, so a mischievous programmer could devise BLOBs
that are similar to JSONB but that are technically malformed. When
misformatted JSONB is feed into JSON functions, any of the following
might happen:



* The SQL statement might abort with a "malformed JSON" error.
* The correct answer might be returned, if the malformed parts of
the JSONB blob do not impact the answer.
* A goofy or nonsensical answer might be returned.



The way in which SQLite handles invalid JSONB might change
from one version of SQLite to the next. The system follows
the garbage\-in/garbage\-out rule: If you feed the JSON functions invalid
JSONB, you get back an invalid answer. If you are in doubt about the
validity of our JSONB, use the [json\_valid()](json1.html#jvalid) function to verify it.




We do make this one promise:
Malformed JSONB will never cause a memory
error or similar problem that might lead to a vulnerability.
Invalid JSONB might lead to crazy answers,
or it might cause queries to abort, but it won't cause a crash.
