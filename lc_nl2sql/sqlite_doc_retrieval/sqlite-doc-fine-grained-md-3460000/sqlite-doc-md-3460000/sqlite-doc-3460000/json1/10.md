## 3\.5\. Compatibility



The current implementation of this JSON library uses a recursive descent
parser. In order to avoid using excess stack space, any JSON input that has
more than 1000 levels of nesting is considered invalid. Limits on nesting
depth are allowed for compatible implementations of JSON by
[RFC\-8259 section 9](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-9).
