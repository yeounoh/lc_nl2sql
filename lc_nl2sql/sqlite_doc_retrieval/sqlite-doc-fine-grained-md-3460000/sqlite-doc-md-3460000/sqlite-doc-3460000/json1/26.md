## 4\.12\. The json\_object() function


The json\_object() SQL function accepts zero or more pairs of arguments
and returns a well\-formed JSON object that is composed from those arguments.
The first argument of each pair is the label and the second argument of
each pair is the value.
If any argument to json\_object() is a BLOB then an error is thrown.



The json\_object() function currently allows duplicate labels without
complaint, though this might change in a future enhancement.



An argument with SQL type TEXT it is normally converted into a quoted 
JSON string even if the input text is well\-formed JSON. 
However, if the argument is the direct result from another JSON
function or [the \-\> operator](json1.html#jptr) (but not [the \-\>\> operator](json1.html#jptr)), 
then it is treated as JSON and all of its JSON type information
and substructure is preserved. This allows calls to json\_object()
and [json\_array()](json1.html#jarray) to be nested. The [json()](json1.html#jmini) function can also
be used to force strings to be recognized as JSON.



Examples:

* json\_object('a',2,'c',4\)
→ '{"a":2,"c":4}'
* json\_object('a',2,'c','{e:5}')
→ '{"a":2,"c":"{e:5}"}'
* json\_object('a',2,'c',json\_object('e',5\))
→ '{"a":2,"c":{"e":5}}'
