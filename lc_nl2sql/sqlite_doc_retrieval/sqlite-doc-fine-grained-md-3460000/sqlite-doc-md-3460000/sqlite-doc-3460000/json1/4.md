## 3\.1\. JSON arguments



For functions that accept JSON as their first argument, that argument
can be a JSON object, array, number, string, or null. SQLite numeric
values and NULL values are interpreted as JSON numbers and nulls, respectively.
SQLite text values can be understood as JSON objects, arrays, or strings.
If an SQLite text value that is not a well\-formed JSON object, array, or
string is passed into JSON function, that function will usually throw
an error. (Exceptions to this rule are [json\_valid()](json1.html#jvalid),
[json\_quote()](json1.html#jquote), and [json\_error\_position()](json1.html#jerr).)




These routines understand all
[rfc\-8259 JSON syntax](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259.txt)
and also [JSON5 extensions](https://spec.json5.org/). JSON text
generated by these routines always strictly conforms to the
[canonical JSON definition](https://json.org) and does not contain any JSON5
or other extensions. The ability to read and understand JSON5 was added in
version 3\.42\.0 (2023\-05\-16\).
Prior versions of SQLite would only read canonical JSON.
