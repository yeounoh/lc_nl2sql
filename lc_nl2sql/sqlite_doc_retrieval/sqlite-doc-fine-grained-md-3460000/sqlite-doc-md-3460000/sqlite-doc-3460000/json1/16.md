## 4\.2\. The jsonb() function


The jsonb(X) function returns the binary JSONB representation
of the JSON provided as argument X. An error is raised if X is
TEXT that does not have valid JSON syntax.



If X is a BLOB and appears to be JSONB,
then this routine simply returns a copy of X.
Only the outer\-most element of the JSONB input is examined, however.
The deep structure of the JSONB is not validated.
