## 3\.7\. Performance Considerations



Most JSON functions do their internal processing using JSONB. So if the
input is text, they first most translate the input text into JSONB.
If the input is already in the JSONB format, no translation is needed,
that step can be skipped, and performance is faster.




For that reason,
when an argument to one JSON function is supplied by another
JSON function, it is usually more efficient to use the "jsonb\_"
variant for the function used as the argument. 



* ... json\_insert(A,'$.b',json(C)) ...
   ← Less efficient.
* ... json\_insert(A,'$.b',jsonb(C)) ...
   ← More efficient.



The [aggregate JSON SQL functions](json1.html#jgroupobjectb) are an exception to this rule. Those
functions all do their processing using text instead of JSONB. So for the
aggregate JSON SQL functions, it is more efficient for the arguments
to be supplied using "json\_" functions than "jsonb\_"
functions.



* ... json\_group\_array(json(A))) ...
   ← More efficient.
* ... json\_group\_array(jsonb(A))) ...
   ← Less efficient.
