## 3\.2\. JSONB



Beginning with version 3\.45\.0 (2024\-01\-15\), SQLite allows its
internal "parse tree" representation of JSON to be stored on disk,
as a BLOB, in a format that we call "JSONB". By storing SQLite's internal
binary representation of JSON directly in the database, applications
can bypass the overhead of parsing and rendering JSON when reading and
updating JSON values. The internal JSONB format also uses slightly
less disk space then text JSON.




Any SQL function parameter that accepts text JSON as an input will also
accept a BLOB in the JSONB format. The function will operate the
same in either case, except that it will run faster when
the input is JSONB, since it does not need to run the JSON parser.




Most SQL functions that return JSON text have a corresponding function
that returns the equivalent JSONB. The functions that return JSON
in the text format begin with "json\_" and functions that
return the binary JSONB format begin with "jsonb\_".
