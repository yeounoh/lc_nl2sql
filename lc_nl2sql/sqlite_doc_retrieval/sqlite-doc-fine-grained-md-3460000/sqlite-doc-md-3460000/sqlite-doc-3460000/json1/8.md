## 3\.3\. PATH arguments



For functions that accept PATH arguments, that PATH must be well\-formed or
else the function will throw an error.
A well\-formed PATH is a text value that begins with exactly one
'$' character followed by zero or more instances
of ".*objectlabel*" or "\[*arrayindex*]".




The *arrayindex* is usually a non\-negative integer *N*. In
that case, the array element selected is the *N*\-th element
of the array, starting with zero on the left.
The *arrayindex* can also be of the form "**\#\-***N*"
in which case the element selected is the *N*\-th from the
right. The last element of the array is "**\#\-1**". Think of
the "\#" characters as the "number of elements in the array". Then
the expression "\#\-1" evaluates to the integer that corresponds to 
the last entry in the array. It is sometimes useful for the array
index to be just the **\#** character, for example when appending
a value to an existing JSON array:

* json\_set('\[0,1,2]','$\[\#]','new')
â†’ '\[0,1,2,"new"]'
