### 3\.2\.1\. The JSONB format



JSONB is a binary representation of JSON used by SQLite and
is intended for internal use by SQLite only. Applications
should not use JSONB outside of SQLite nor try to reverse\-engineer the
JSONB format.




The "JSONB" name is inspired by [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org), but the
on\-disk format for SQLite's JSONB is not the same as PostgreSQL's.
The two formats have the same name, but are not binary compatible.
The PostgreSQL JSONB format claims to offer O(1\)
lookup of elements in objects and arrays. SQLite's JSONB format makes no
such claim. SQLite's JSONB has O(N) time complexity for
most operations in SQLite, just like text JSON. The advantage of JSONB in
SQLite is that it is smaller and faster than text JSON \- potentially several
times faster. There is space in the
on\-disk JSONB format to add enhancements and future versions of SQLite might
include options to provide O(1\) lookup of elements in JSONB, but no such
capability is currently available.
