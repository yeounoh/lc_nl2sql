## Suggested Uses For SQLite:


* **Database For The Internet Of Things.**
SQLite is popular choice for the database engine in cellphones,
PDAs, MP3 players, set\-top boxes, and other electronic gadgets.
SQLite has a small code footprint, makes efficient use of memory,
disk space, and disk bandwidth, is highly reliable, and requires
no maintenance from a Database Administrator.
* **Application File Format.**
Rather than using fopen() to write XML, JSON, CSV,
or some proprietary format into
disk files used by your application, use an SQLite database.
You'll avoid having to write and troubleshoot a parser, your data
will be more easily accessible and cross\-platform, and your updates
will be transactional. ([more...](appfileformat.html))
* **Website Database.**
Because it requires no configuration and stores information in ordinary
disk files, SQLite is a popular choice as the database to back small
to medium\-sized websites.
* **Stand\-in For An Enterprise RDBMS.**
SQLite is often used as a surrogate for an enterprise RDBMS for
demonstration purposes or for testing. SQLite is fast and requires
no setup, which takes a lot of the hassle out of testing and which
makes demos perky and easy to launch.
