# 2\. Advantages of Lemon


Lemon generates an LALR(1\) parser. Its operation is similar to the
more familiar tools [Yacc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc) and
[Bison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_bison), but Lemon adds important
improvements, including:



* The grammar syntax is less error prone \- using symbolic names for
 semantic values rather that the "$1"\-style positional notation
 of Yacc.
* In Lemon, the tokenizer calls the parser. Yacc operates the other
 way around, with the parser calling the tokenizer. The Lemon
 approach is reentrant and threadsafe, whereas Yacc uses global 
 variables and is therefore neither. Reentrancy is especially
 important for SQLite since some SQL statements make recursive calls
 to the parser. For example, when parsing a CREATE TABLE statement,
 SQLite invokes the parser recursively to generate an INSERT statement
 to make a new entry in the [sqlite\_schema](schematab.html) table.
* Lemon has the concept of a non\-terminal destructor that can be
 used to reclaim memory or other resources following a syntax error
 or other aborted parse.
