# 3\. History Of Lemon


Lemon was originally written by D. Richard Hipp (also the creator of SQLite)
while he was in graduate school at Duke University between 1987 and 1992\.
The original creation date of Lemon has been lost, but was probably sometime
around 1990\. Lemon generates an LALR(1\) parser. There was a companion 
LL(1\) parser generator tool named "Lime", but the source code for Lime
has been lost.



The Lemon source code was originally written as separate source files,
and only later merged into a single "lemon.c" source file.



The author of Lemon and SQLite (Hipp) reports that his C programming
skills were greatly enhanced by studying John Ousterhout's original
source code to Tcl. Hipp discovered and studied Tcl in 1993\. Lemon
was written before then, and SQLite afterwards. There is a clear
difference in the coding styles of these two products, with SQLite seeming
to be cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain.
