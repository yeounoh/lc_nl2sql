## 2\.1\. Use of Lemon Within SQLite


Lemon is used in two places in SQLite.



The primary use of Lemon is to create the SQL language parser.
A grammar file ([parse.y](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/parse.y)) is
compiled by Lemon into parse.c and parse.h. The parse.c file is
incorporated into the [amalgamation](amalgamation.html) without further modification.



Lemon is also used to generate the parser for the query pattern
expressions in the [FTS5](fts5.html) extension. In this case, the input grammar
file is [fts5parse.y](https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/fts5/fts5parse.y).
