## Invert A Changeset


> ```
> int sqlite3changeset_invert(
>   int nIn, const void *pIn,       /* Input changeset */
>   int *pnOut, void **ppOut        /* OUT: Inverse of input */
> );
> 
> ```


This function is used to "invert" a changeset object. Applying an inverted
changeset to a database reverses the effects of applying the uninverted
changeset. Specifically:


* Each DELETE change is changed to an INSERT, and
 * Each INSERT change is changed to a DELETE, and
 * For each UPDATE change, the old.\* and new.\* values are exchanged.



This function does not change the order in which changes appear within
the changeset. It merely reverses the sense of each individual change.


If successful, a pointer to a buffer containing the inverted changeset
is stored in \*ppOut, the size of the same buffer is stored in \*pnOut, and
SQLITE\_OK is returned. If an error occurs, both \*pnOut and \*ppOut are
zeroed and an SQLite error code returned.


It is the responsibility of the caller to eventually call sqlite3\_free()
on the \*ppOut pointer to free the buffer allocation following a successful 
call to this function.


WARNING/TODO: This function currently assumes that the input is a valid
changeset. If it is not, the results are undefined.
