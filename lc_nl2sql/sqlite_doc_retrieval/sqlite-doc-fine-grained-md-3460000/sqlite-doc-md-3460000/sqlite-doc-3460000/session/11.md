## Add A Changeset To A Changegroup


> ```
> int sqlite3changegroup_add(sqlite3_changegroup*, int nData, void *pData);
> 
> ```


Add all changes within the changeset (or patchset) in buffer pData (size
nData bytes) to the changegroup. 


If the buffer contains a patchset, then all prior calls to this function
on the same changegroup object must also have specified patchsets. Or, if
the buffer contains a changeset, so must have the earlier calls to this
function. Otherwise, SQLITE\_ERROR is returned and no changes are added
to the changegroup.


Rows within the changeset and changegroup are identified by the values in
their PRIMARY KEY columns. A change in the changeset is considered to
apply to the same row as a change already present in the changegroup if
the two rows have the same primary key.


Changes to rows that do not already appear in the changegroup are
simply copied into it. Or, if both the new changeset and the changegroup
contain changes that apply to a single row, the final contents of the
changegroup depends on the type of each change, as follows:




| Existing Change | New Change | Output Change  | INSERT  INSERT  The new change is ignored. This case does not occur if the new  changeset was recorded immediately after the changesets already  added to the changegroup.  | INSERT  UPDATE  The INSERT change remains in the changegroup. The values in the   INSERT change are modified as if the row was inserted by the  existing change and then updated according to the new change.  | INSERT  DELETE  The existing INSERT is removed from the changegroup. The DELETE is  not added.  | UPDATE  INSERT  The new change is ignored. This case does not occur if the new  changeset was recorded immediately after the changesets already  added to the changegroup.  | UPDATE  UPDATE  The existing UPDATE remains within the changegroup. It is amended   so that the accompanying values are as if the row was updated once   by the existing change and then again by the new change.  | UPDATE  DELETE  The existing UPDATE is replaced by the new DELETE within the  changegroup.  | DELETE  INSERT  If one or more of the column values in the row inserted by the  new change differ from those in the row deleted by the existing   change, the existing DELETE is replaced by an UPDATE within the  changegroup. Otherwise, if the inserted row is exactly the same   as the deleted row, the existing DELETE is simply discarded.  | DELETE  UPDATE  The new change is ignored. This case does not occur if the new  changeset was recorded immediately after the changesets already  added to the changegroup.  | DELETE  DELETE  The new change is ignored. This case does not occur if the new  changeset was recorded immediately after the changesets already  added to the changegroup. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |




If the new changeset contains changes to a table that is already present
in the changegroup, then the number of columns and the position of the
primary key columns for the table must be consistent. If this is not the
case, this function fails with SQLITE\_SCHEMA. Except, if the changegroup
object has been configured with a database schema using the
sqlite3changegroup\_schema() API, then it is possible to combine changesets
with different numbers of columns for a single table, provided that
they are otherwise compatible.


If the input changeset appears to be corrupt and the corruption is
detected, SQLITE\_CORRUPT is returned. Or, if an out\-of\-memory condition
occurs during processing, this function returns SQLITE\_NOMEM. 


In all cases, if an error occurs the state of the final contents of the
changegroup is undefined. If no error occurs, SQLITE\_OK is returned.
