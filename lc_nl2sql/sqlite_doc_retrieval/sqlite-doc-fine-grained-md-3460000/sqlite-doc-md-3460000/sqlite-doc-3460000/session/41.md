## Enable Or Disable A Session Object


> ```
> int sqlite3session_enable(sqlite3_session *pSession, int bEnable);
> 
> ```


Enable or disable the recording of changes by a session object. When
enabled, a session object records changes made to the database. When
disabled \- it does not. A newly created session object is enabled.
Refer to the documentation for [sqlite3session\_changeset()](#sqlite3session_changeset) for further
details regarding how enabling and disabling a session object affects
the eventual changesets.


Passing zero to this function disables the session. Passing a value
greater than zero enables it. Passing a value less than zero is a 
no\-op, and may be used to query the current state of the session.


The return value indicates the final state of the session object: 0 if 
the session is disabled, or 1 if it is enabled.
