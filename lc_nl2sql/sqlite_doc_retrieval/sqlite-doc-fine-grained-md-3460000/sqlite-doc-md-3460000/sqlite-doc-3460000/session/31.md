## Rebase a changeset


> ```
> int sqlite3rebaser_rebase(

Argument pIn must point to a buffer containing a changeset nIn bytes
in size. This function allocates and populates a buffer with a copy
of the changeset rebased according to the configuration of the
rebaser object passed as the first argument. If successful, (\*ppOut)
is set to point to the new buffer containing the rebased changeset and 
(\*pnOut) to its size in bytes and SQLITE\_OK returned. It is the
responsibility of the caller to eventually free the new buffer using
sqlite3\_free(). Otherwise, if an error occurs, (\*ppOut) and (\*pnOut)
are set to zero and an SQLite error code returned.
