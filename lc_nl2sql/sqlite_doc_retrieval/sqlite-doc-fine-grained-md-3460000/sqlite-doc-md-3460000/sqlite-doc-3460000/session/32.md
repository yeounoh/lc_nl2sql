## Attach A Table To A Session Object


> ```
> int sqlite3session_attach(
>   sqlite3_session *pSession,      /* Session object */
>   const char *zTab                /* Table name */
> );
> 
> ```


If argument zTab is not NULL, then it is the name of a table to attach
to the session object passed as the first argument. All subsequent changes 
made to the table while the session object is enabled will be recorded. See 
documentation for [sqlite3session\_changeset()](#sqlite3session_changeset) for further details.


Or, if argument zTab is NULL, then changes are recorded for all tables
in the database. If additional tables are added to the database (by 
executing "CREATE TABLE" statements) after this call is made, changes for 
the new tables are also recorded.


Changes can only be recorded for tables that have a PRIMARY KEY explicitly
defined as part of their CREATE TABLE statement. It does not matter if the 
PRIMARY KEY is an "INTEGER PRIMARY KEY" (rowid alias) or not. The PRIMARY
KEY may consist of a single column, or may be a composite key.


It is not an error if the named table does not exist in the database. Nor
is it an error if the named table does not have a PRIMARY KEY. However,
no changes will be recorded in either of these scenarios.


Changes are not recorded for individual rows that have NULL values stored
in one or more of their PRIMARY KEY columns.


SQLITE\_OK is returned if the call completes without error. Or, if an error 
occurs, an SQLite error code (e.g. SQLITE\_NOMEM) is returned.
