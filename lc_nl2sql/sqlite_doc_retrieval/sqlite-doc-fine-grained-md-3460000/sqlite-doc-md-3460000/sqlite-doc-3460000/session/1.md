## SQLite Session Module C/C\+\+ Interface


This page defines the C\-language interface to the SQLite
 [session extension](sessionintro.html).
 This is not a tutorial. These pages are designed to be precise, not easy
 to read. A tutorial is [available separately](sessionintro.html).

This page contains all C\-language interface information
in a single HTML file. The same information is also available
broken out into [some smaller pages](../session/intro.html)
for easier viewing, if you prefer.


This document is created by a script which scans comments in the source
code file sqlite3session.h.
