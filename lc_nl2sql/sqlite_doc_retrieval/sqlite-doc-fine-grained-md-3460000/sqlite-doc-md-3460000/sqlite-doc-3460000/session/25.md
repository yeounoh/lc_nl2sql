## Obtain The Current Operation From A Changeset Iterator


> ```
> int sqlite3changeset_op(
>   sqlite3_changeset_iter *pIter,  /* Iterator object */
>   const char **pzTab,             /* OUT: Pointer to table name */
>   int *pnCol,                     /* OUT: Number of columns in table */
>   int *pOp,                       /* OUT: SQLITE_INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE */
>   int *pbIndirect                 /* OUT: True for an 'indirect' change */
> );
> 
> ```


The pIter argument passed to this function may either be an iterator
passed to a conflict\-handler by [sqlite3changeset\_apply()](#sqlite3changeset_apply), or an iterator
created by [sqlite3changeset\_start()](#sqlite3changeset_start). In the latter case, the most recent
call to [sqlite3changeset\_next()](#sqlite3changeset_next) must have returned [SQLITE\_ROW](rescode.html#row). If this
is not the case, this function returns [SQLITE\_MISUSE](rescode.html#misuse).


Arguments pOp, pnCol and pzTab may not be NULL. Upon return, three
outputs are set through these pointers: 


\*pOp is set to one of [SQLITE\_INSERT](c3ref/c_alter_table.html), [SQLITE\_DELETE](c3ref/c_alter_table.html) or [SQLITE\_UPDATE](c3ref/c_alter_table.html),
depending on the type of change that the iterator currently points to;


\*pnCol is set to the number of columns in the table affected by the change; and


\*pzTab is set to point to a nul\-terminated utf\-8 encoded string containing
the name of the table affected by the current change. The buffer remains
valid until either sqlite3changeset\_next() is called on the iterator
or until the conflict\-handler function returns.


If pbIndirect is not NULL, then \*pbIndirect is set to true (1\) if the change
is an indirect change, or false (0\) otherwise. See the documentation for
[sqlite3session\_indirect()](#sqlite3session_indirect) for a description of direct and indirect
changes.


If no error occurs, SQLITE\_OK is returned. If an error does occur, an
SQLite error code is returned. The values of the output variables may not
be trusted in this case.
