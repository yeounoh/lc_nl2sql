Create an iterator used to iterate through the contents of a changeset.
If successful, \*pp is set to point to the iterator handle and SQLITE\_OK
is returned. Otherwise, if an error occurs, \*pp is set to zero and an
SQLite error code is returned.


The following functions can be used to advance and query a changeset 
iterator created by this function:


* [sqlite3changeset\_next()](#sqlite3changeset_next)* [sqlite3changeset\_op()](#sqlite3changeset_op)* [sqlite3changeset\_new()](#sqlite3changeset_new)* [sqlite3changeset\_old()](#sqlite3changeset_old)



It is the responsibility of the caller to eventually destroy the iterator
by passing it to [sqlite3changeset\_finalize()](#sqlite3changeset_finalize). The buffer containing the
changeset (pChangeset) must remain valid until after the iterator is
destroyed.


Assuming the changeset blob was created by one of the
[sqlite3session\_changeset()](#sqlite3session_changeset), [sqlite3changeset\_concat()](#sqlite3changeset_concat) or
[sqlite3changeset\_invert()](#sqlite3changeset_invert) functions, all changes within the changeset 
that apply to a single table are grouped together. This means that when 
an application iterates through a changeset using an iterator created by 
this function, all changes that relate to a single table are visited 
consecutively. There is no chance that the iterator will visit a change 
the applies to table X, then one for table Y, and then later on visit 
another change for table X.


The behavior of sqlite3changeset\_start\_v2() and its streaming equivalent
may be modified by passing a combination of
[supported flags](#SQLITE_CHANGESETSTART_INVERT) as the 4th parameter.


Note that the sqlite3changeset\_start\_v2() API is still **experimental**
and therefore subject to change.
