## Constants Returned By The Conflict Handler


> ```
> #define SQLITE_CHANGESET_OMIT       0
> #define SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE    1
> #define SQLITE_CHANGESET_ABORT      2
> 
> ```


A conflict handler callback must return one of the following three values.



SQLITE\_CHANGESET\_OMIT
 If a conflict handler returns this value no special action is taken. The
 change that caused the conflict is not applied. The session module 
 continues to the next change in the changeset.


SQLITE\_CHANGESET\_REPLACE
 This value may only be returned if the second argument to the conflict
 handler was SQLITE\_CHANGESET\_DATA or SQLITE\_CHANGESET\_CONFLICT. If this
 is not the case, any changes applied so far are rolled back and the 
 call to sqlite3changeset\_apply() returns SQLITE\_MISUSE.


 If CHANGESET\_REPLACE is returned by an SQLITE\_CHANGESET\_DATA conflict
 handler, then the conflicting row is either updated or deleted, depending
 on the type of change.


 If CHANGESET\_REPLACE is returned by an SQLITE\_CHANGESET\_CONFLICT conflict
 handler, then the conflicting row is removed from the database and a
 second attempt to apply the change is made. If this second attempt fails,
 the original row is restored to the database before continuing.


SQLITE\_CHANGESET\_ABORT
 If this value is returned, any changes applied so far are rolled back 
 and the call to sqlite3changeset\_apply() returns SQLITE\_ABORT.
