## Options for sqlite3session\_object\_config


> ```
> #define SQLITE_SESSION_OBJCONFIG_SIZE  1
> #define SQLITE_SESSION_OBJCONFIG_ROWID 2
> 
> ```


The following values may passed as the the 2nd parameter to
sqlite3session\_object\_config().


SQLITE\_SESSION\_OBJCONFIG\_SIZE 
 This option is used to set, clear or query the flag that enables
 the [sqlite3session\_changeset\_size()](#sqlite3session_changeset_size) API. Because it imposes some
 computational overhead, this API is disabled by default. Argument
 pArg must point to a value of type (int). If the value is initially
 0, then the sqlite3session\_changeset\_size() API is disabled. If it
 is greater than 0, then the same API is enabled. Or, if the initial
 value is less than zero, no change is made. In all cases the (int)
 variable is set to 1 if the sqlite3session\_changeset\_size() API is
 enabled following the current call, or 0 otherwise.


 It is an error (SQLITE\_MISUSE) to attempt to modify this setting after 
 the first table has been attached to the session object.


SQLITE\_SESSION\_OBJCONFIG\_ROWID 
 This option is used to set, clear or query the flag that enables
 collection of data for tables with no explicit PRIMARY KEY.


 Normally, tables with no explicit PRIMARY KEY are simply ignored
 by the sessions module. However, if this flag is set, it behaves
 as if such tables have a column "\_rowid\_ INTEGER PRIMARY KEY" inserted
 as their leftmost columns.
