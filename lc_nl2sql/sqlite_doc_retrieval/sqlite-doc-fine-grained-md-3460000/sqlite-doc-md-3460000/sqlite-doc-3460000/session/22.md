## Obtain new.\* Values From A Changeset Iterator


> ```
> int sqlite3changeset_new(
>   sqlite3_changeset_iter *pIter,  /* Changeset iterator */
>   int iVal,                       /* Column number */
>   sqlite3_value **ppValue         /* OUT: New value (or NULL pointer) */
> );
> 
> ```


The pIter argument passed to this function may either be an iterator
passed to a conflict\-handler by [sqlite3changeset\_apply()](#sqlite3changeset_apply), or an iterator
created by [sqlite3changeset\_start()](#sqlite3changeset_start). In the latter case, the most recent
call to [sqlite3changeset\_next()](#sqlite3changeset_next) must have returned SQLITE\_ROW. 
Furthermore, it may only be called if the type of change that the iterator
currently points to is either [SQLITE\_UPDATE](c3ref/c_alter_table.html) or [SQLITE\_INSERT](c3ref/c_alter_table.html). Otherwise,
this function returns [SQLITE\_MISUSE](rescode.html#misuse) and sets \*ppValue to NULL.


Argument iVal must be greater than or equal to 0, and less than the number
of columns in the table affected by the current change. Otherwise,
[SQLITE\_RANGE](rescode.html#range) is returned and \*ppValue is set to NULL.


If successful, this function sets \*ppValue to point to a protected
sqlite3\_value object containing the iVal'th value from the vector of 
new row values stored as part of the UPDATE or INSERT change and
returns SQLITE\_OK. If the change is an UPDATE and does not include
a new value for the requested column, \*ppValue is set to NULL and 
SQLITE\_OK returned. The name of the function comes from the fact that 
this is similar to the "new.\*" columns available to update or delete 
triggers.


If some other error occurs (e.g. an OOM condition), an SQLite error code
is returned and \*ppValue is set to NULL.
