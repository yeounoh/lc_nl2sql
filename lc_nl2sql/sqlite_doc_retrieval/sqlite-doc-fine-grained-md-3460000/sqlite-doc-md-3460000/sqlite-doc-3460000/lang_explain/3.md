## 2\.1\. EXPLAIN operates at run\-time, not at prepare\-time


The EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN prefixes affect the behavior of
running a [prepared statement](c3ref/stmt.html) using [sqlite3\_step()](c3ref/step.html). The process of
generating a new prepared statement using [sqlite3\_prepare()](c3ref/prepare.html) or similar
is (mostly) unaffected by EXPLAIN. (The exception to the previous sentence
is that some special opcodes used by EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN are omitted when
building an EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN prepared statement, as a performance
optimization.)



This means that actions that occur during sqlite3\_prepare() are
unaffected by EXPLAIN.



* Some [PRAGMA](pragma.html#syntax) statements do their work during sqlite3\_prepare() rather
than during sqlite3\_step(). Those PRAGMA statements are unaffected
by EXPLAIN. They operate the same with or without the EXPLAIN prefix.
The set of PRAGMA statements that are unaffected by EXPLAIN can vary
from one release to the next. Some PRAGMA statements operate during
sqlite3\_prepare() depending on their arguments. For consistent
results, avoid using EXPLAIN on PRAGMA statements.
* The [authorizer callback](c3ref/set_authorizer.html) is invoked regardless of the presence of
EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN.
