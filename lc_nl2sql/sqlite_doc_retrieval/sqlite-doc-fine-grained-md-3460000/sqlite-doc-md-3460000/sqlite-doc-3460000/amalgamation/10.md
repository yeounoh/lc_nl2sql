#include "sqlite3-7.c"

```

Applications using the split amalgamation simply compile against
"sqlite3\-all.c" instead of "sqlite3\.c". The two files work exactly
the same. But with "sqlite3\-all.c", no single source file contains more
than 32,767 lines of code, and so it is more convenient to use some
debuggers. The downside of the split amalgamation is that it consists
of 6 C source code files instead of just 1\.
