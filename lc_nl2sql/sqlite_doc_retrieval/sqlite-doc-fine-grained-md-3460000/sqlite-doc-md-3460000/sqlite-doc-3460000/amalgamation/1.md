# 1\. Executive Summary


Over 100 separate source files are concatenated into a
single large file of C\-code named "sqlite3\.c" and
referred to as "the amalgamation". The amalgamation
contains everything an application needs to embed SQLite.



Combining all the code for SQLite into one big file makes SQLite
easier to deploy â€” there is just one file to keep track of.
And because all code is in
a single translation unit, compilers can do
better inter\-procedure and inlining optimization
resulting in machine code that is between 5% and 10% faster.
