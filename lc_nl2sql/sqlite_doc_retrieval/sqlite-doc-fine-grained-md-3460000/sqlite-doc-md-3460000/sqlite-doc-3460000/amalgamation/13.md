## 5\.1\. Dependencies


The build process makes extensive use of the
[Tcl](http://www.tcl-lang.org/) scripting language. You will need to have a
copy of TCL installed in order for the make targets above to work.
Easy\-to\-use installers can be obtained from [http://www.tcl\-lang.org/](http://www.tcl-lang.org/).
Many unix workstations have Tcl installed by default.
