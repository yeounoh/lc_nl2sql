# 5\. Building The Amalgamation From Canonical Source Code


To build the amalgamation (either the full amalgamation or the
split amalgamation), first
[get the canonical source code](getthecode.html) from one of the three servers.
Then, on both unix\-like systems and on Windows systems that have the
free [MinGW](http://mingw.org/wiki/msys) development environment
installed, the amalgamation can be built using the
following commands:




```
sh configure
make sqlite3.c

```

To build using Microsoft Visual C\+\+, run this command:




```
nmake /f makefile.msc sqlite3.c

```

In both cases, the split amalgamation can be obtained by
substituting "sqlite3\-all.c" for "sqlite3\.c" as the make target.
