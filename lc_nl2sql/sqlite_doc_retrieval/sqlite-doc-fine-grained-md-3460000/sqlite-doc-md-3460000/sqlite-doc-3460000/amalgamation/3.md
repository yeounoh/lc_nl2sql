# 3\. The Split Amalgamation


Developers sometimes experience trouble debugging the
quarter\-million line amalgamation source file because some debuggers
are only able to handle source code line numbers less than 32,768\.
The amalgamation source code runs fine. One just cannot single\-step
through it in a debugger.



To circumvent this limitation, the amalgamation is also available in
a split form, consisting of files "sqlite3\-1\.c", "sqlite3\-2\.c", and
so forth, where each file is less than 32,768 lines in length and
where the concatenation of the files contain all of the code for the
complete amalgamation. Then there is a separate source file named
"sqlite3\-all.c" which basically consists of code like this:
