## Notes:


1. SQLite never assumes atomic page writes *in its default configurations*.
But a custom [VFS](vfs.html) can set one of the 
[SQLITE\_IOCAP\_ATOMIC](c3ref/c_iocap_atomic.html) bits in the result of the xDeviceCharacteristic()
method and then SQLite will assume that page writes are atomic. The
application must supply a custom VFS to accomplish this, however, since
none of the standard VFSes will ever set any of the atomic bits in the
xDeviceCharacteristics() vector.
