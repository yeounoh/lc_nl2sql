## Changes In SQLite Version 3\.7\.10


The [VFS](vfs.html) for SQLite [version 3\.7\.10](releaselog/3_7_10.html) (2012\-01\-16\)
adds a new device characteristic 
named [SQLITE\_IOCAP\_POWERSAFE\_OVERWRITE](c3ref/c_iocap_atomic.html). Database files that report this
characteristic are assumed to reside on storage systems that have the
powersafe overwrite property.
The default unix and windows [VFSes](vfs.html) now report
[SQLITE\_IOCAP\_POWERSAFE\_OVERWRITE](c3ref/c_iocap_atomic.html) if SQLite is compiled with
[\-DSQLITE\_POWERSAFE\_OVERWRITE\=1](compile.html#powersafe_overwrite) or they
make the legacy assumption that storage does not have the powersafe
overwrite property if compiled with
[\-DSQLITE\_POWERSAFE\_OVERWRITE\=0](compile.html#powersafe_overwrite).
For now, the default is for powersafe overwrite to be turned on, though
we may revisit this in the future and default it off.

The powersafe overwrite property for individual databases can be
specified as the database is opened using the "psow" query parameter
with a [URI filename](uri.html). For example, to always assume powersafe
overwrite for a file (perhaps to ensure maximum write performance), 
open it as


> file:somefile.db?psow\=1


Or to be extra safe with a database and to force SQLite to assume the
database lacks powersafe overwrite, open it using


> file:somefile.db?psow\=0


There is also a new [SQLITE\_FCNTL\_POWERSAFE\_OVERWRITE](c3ref/c_fcntl_begin_atomic_write.html#sqlitefcntlpowersafeoverwrite) opcode for
the [sqlite3\_file\_control()](c3ref/file_control.html) that allows
an application to query the powersafe overwrite property for a database
file.
