## Torn Pages


A torn page occurs when a database page is larger than a disk sector,
the database page is written to disk, but a power loss occurs prior to
all sectors of the database page being written. Then, upon recovery, part of
the database page will have the old content while some other parts of the
page will have the new content. Some database engines assume that 
page writes are atomic and hence a torn page is an unrecoverable error.



SQLite never assumes that database page writes are atomic,
regardless of the PSOW setting.(1\)
And hence SQLite is always able to automatically recover from torn pages
induced by a crash. Enabling PSOW does not decrease SQLite's ability
to recover from a torn page.
