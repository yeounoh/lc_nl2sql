# 1\. Overview



The SQLITE\_MEMSTAT extension implements an [eponymous\-only virtual table](vtab.html#epoonlyvtab) that
provides SQL access to the [sqlite3\_status64()](c3ref/status.html) and
[sqlite3\_db\_status()](c3ref/db_status.html) interfaces.




The SQLITE\_STMT extension can also be loaded at run\-time
by compiling the extension into a shared library or DLL using the source
code at <https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/memstat.c> and following the
instructions for how to [compile loadable extensions](loadext.html#build).
