# 1\. Overview


The graph below shows the number of CPU cycles used by SQLite on a
standard workload, for versions of SQLite going back about 10 years.
Recent versions of SQLite use about one third as many the CPU cycles
compared to older versions.




This article describes how the SQLite developers measure CPU usage,
what those measurements actually mean, and the techniques used by
SQLite developers on their continuing quest to further reduce the
CPU usage of the SQLite library.
