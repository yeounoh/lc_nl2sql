## 2\.4\. Microoptimizations



The high repeatability of cachegrind allows the SQLite developers to
implement and measure "microoptimizations". A microoptimization is
a change to the code that results in a very small performance increase.
Typical micro\-optimizations reduce the number of CPU cycles by 0\.1% or
0\.05% or even less. Such improvements are impossible to measure with
real\-world timings. But hundreds or thousands of microoptimizations
add up, resulting in measurable real\-world performance gains.
