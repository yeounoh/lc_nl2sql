# 4\. Limitations


The use of the standardized speedtest1\.c workload and cachegrind has
enabled significant performance improvement.
However, it is important to recognize the limitations of this approach:



* Performance measurements are done with a single compiler (gcc 5\.4\.0\),
optimization setting (\-Os), and
on a single platform (Ubuntu 16\.04 LTS on x64\). The performance of
other compilers and processors may vary.
* The speedtest1\.c workload that is being measured tries to be representative
of a wide range of typical uses of SQLite. But every application is
different. The speedtest1\.c workload might not be a good proxy for the
kinds of activities performed by some applications. The SQLite developers
are constantly working to improve the speedtest1\.c program, to make it
a better proxy for actual SQLite usage. Community feedback is welcomed.
* The cycle counts provided by cachegrind are a good proxy for actual
performance, but they are not 100% accurate.
* Only CPU cycle counts are being measured here. 
CPU cycle counts are a good proxy for energy consumption,
but do not necessary correlate well with real\-world timings.
Time spent doing I/O is not reflected in the CPU cycle counts,
and I/O time predominates in many SQLite usage scenarios.
