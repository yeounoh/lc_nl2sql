# 2\. Measuring Performance


In brief, the CPU performance of SQLite is measured as follows:



1. Compile SQLite in an as\-delivered configuration, without any special
 telemetry or debugging options.
2. Link SQLite against a test program that runs approximately 30,000
 SQL statements representing a typical workload.
3. Count the number of CPU cycles consumed using
 [cachegrind](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cg-manual.html).
