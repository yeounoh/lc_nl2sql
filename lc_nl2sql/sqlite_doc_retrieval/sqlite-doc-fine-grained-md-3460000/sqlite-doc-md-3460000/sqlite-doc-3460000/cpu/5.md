## 2\.3\. Performance Measurement



[Cachegrind](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cg-manual.html) is used to
measure performance because it gives answers that are repeatable to 
7 or more significant digits. In comparison, actual (wall\-clock)
run times are scarcely repeatable beyond one significant digit.
