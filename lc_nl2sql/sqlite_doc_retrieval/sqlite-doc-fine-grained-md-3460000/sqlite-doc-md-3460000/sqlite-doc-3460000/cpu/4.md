## 2\.2\. Workload



The "typical" workload is generated by the
[speedtest1\.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/test/speedtest1.c)
program in the canonical SQLite source tree. This program strives to
exercise the SQLite library in a way that is typical of real\-world
applications. Of course, every application is different, and so
no test program can exactly mirror the behavior of all applications.




The speedtest1\.c program is updated from time to time as the SQLite
developers' understanding of what constitutes "typical" usage evolves.




The 
[speed\-check.sh](https://sqlite.org/src/file/tool/speed-check.sh) shell
script, also in the canonical source tree, is used to run the speedtest1\.c
program. To replicate the performance measurements, collect the following
files into a single directory:


* the "speed\-check.sh" script,
* the "speedtest1\.c" test program, and
* the [SQLite amalgamation](amalgamation.html) source files "sqlite3\.c" and
 "sqlite3\.h"



Then run "sh speed\-check.sh trunk".
