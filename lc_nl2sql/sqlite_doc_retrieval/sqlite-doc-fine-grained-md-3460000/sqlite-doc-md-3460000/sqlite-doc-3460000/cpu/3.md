## 2\.1\. Compile Options


For performance measurement, SQLite is compiled in approximately the same
way as it would be for use in production systems. The compile\-time configuration
is "approximate" in the sense that every production use of SQLite is 
different. Compile\-time options used by one system are not necessarily
the same as those used by others. The key point is that options that 
significantly impact the generated machine code are avoided. For example,
the \-DSQLITE\_DEBUG option is omitted because that option inserts thousands
of assert() statements in the middle of performance critical sections of the
SQLite library. The \-pg option (on GCC) is omitted because it causes the
compiler to emit extra probabilistic performance measuring code which interferes
with actual performance measurements.




For performance measurements,
the \-Os option is used (optimize for size) rather than \-O2 because the
\-O2 option creates so much code movement that it is difficult to associate
specific CPU instructions to C source code lines.
