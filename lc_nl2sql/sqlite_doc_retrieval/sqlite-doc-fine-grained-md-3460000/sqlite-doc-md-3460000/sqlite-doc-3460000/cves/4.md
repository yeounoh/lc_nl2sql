## 2\.2\. Defense Against Dark Arts



Most applications can use SQLite without having to worry about
bugs in obscure SQL inputs. If the application controls
the SQL, and the application is not deliberately trying to break
SQLite, then everything should just work.
It is not necessary to have the latest patched version of SQLite.
Any older version should work just fine.




However, there are some occasions where an application does need
to be able to safely run untrusted SQL. The SQLite developers work hard
to make SQLite safe for this purpose, though there are occasional
slip\-ups. It is good to keep up\-to\-date with the latest patches
in this case. The separate [defense against dark arts](security.html) document
contains additional suggestions that can help prevent zero\-day
attacks in cases where SQLite is given inputs that come directly
from untrusted sources.
