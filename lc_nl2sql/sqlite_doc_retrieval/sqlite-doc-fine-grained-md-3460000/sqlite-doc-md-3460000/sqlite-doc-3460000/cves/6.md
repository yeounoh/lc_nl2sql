# 3\. Status Of Recent SQLite CVEs


Though the SQLite developers do not consider CVEs to be a reliable
source of information about bugs in SQLite, they recognize that many
groups, and especially small teams working at the bottom of tall
bureaucracies, sometimes need to track CVEs, whether they are useful
or not. To aid in this chore, the following table of recent CVEs
affecting SQLite is provided.



If you notice new CVEs associated with SQLite that are not in
the table below, please bring them to the attention of the developers
on the [SQLite Forum](https://sqlite.org/forum/about) so they can
be added.





| CVE Number | Fix | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE\-2024\-0232](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0232) | [3\.43\.2](releaselog/3_43_2.html)(2023\-10\-10\) | An attacker that can inject arbitrary SQL statements into an application  might be able to provoke a use\-after\-free bug in SQLite's JSON parser that  can (in theory) lead to an application crash and denial of service. See  [forum thread b25edc1d4662](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/b25edc1d4662ebca)  for the bug report. |
| [CVE\-2023\-32697](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32697) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is a bug in the SQLite JDBC library, which is a wrapper library that  provides access to SQLite from Java. SQLite JDBC is created and maintained  independently from SQLite. Despite the use of "SQLite" in the name, the  SQLite JDBC library is not affiliated with the SQLite project in any way.  The vulnerability identified by this CVE is in the separate SQLite JDBC  wrapper library and does not affect SQLite itself. |
| [CVE\-2023\-39939](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39939) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is not a bug in SQLite. This is an   [SQL injection bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) in an application  (LuxCal Web Calendar) that links against SQLite.  Even though this CVE is not about SQLite, "SQLite" is  mentioned in the description and so we list it here. |
| [CVE\-2023\-39543](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39543) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is not a bug in SQLite. This is an  [XSS vulnerability](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting)  in a separate application (LuxCal Web Calendar) that links against  SQLite. The bug is in the application, not in SQLite. However "SQLite" is  mentioned in the description and so we list it here. |
| [CVE\-2023\-7104](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-7104) | [3\.43\.1](releaselog/3_43_1.html)(2023\-09\-11\) | This is a bug in the [session extension](sessionintro.html) of SQLite, not in the SQLite core.  This bug is only reachable by applications that recompile SQLite using the  [\-DSQLITE\_ENABLE\_SESSION](compile.html#enable_session) compile\-time option and then use the Session  C\-language APIs to process a [changeset](sessionintro.html#changeset) that has been subtly corrupted by an  adversary. So this bug probably does not apply to you. See  [forum post f935c4708dd528d9](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/f935c4708dd528d9)  for additional information. |
| [CVE\-2022\-46908](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46908) | Not a bug in the core SQLite library | This is a bug in the \-\-safe command\-line option of the [command\-line shell](cli.html)  program that is available for accessing SQLite database files. The bug does  not exist in the SQLite library. Nor is it an issue for the [CLI](cli.html) as long as  the user does not depend on the \-\-safe option. It is not serious. It is  debatable whether or not this is a security issue. |
| [CVE\-2022\-38627](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-38627) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is not a bug in SQLite. This is an   [SQL injection bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) in a specific  PHP application. In other words, the bug is in the PHP application code, not  in SQLite. Even though this CVE is not about SQLite, "SQLite" is  mentioned in the publicity about the bug and so we list it here. |
| [CVE\-2022\-35737](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35737) | [3\.39\.2](releaselog/3_39_2.html)(2022\-07\-21\) | This bug is an array\-bounds overflow. The bug is only accessible when using some  of the C\-language APIs provided by SQLite. The bug cannot be reached using SQL  nor can it be reached by providing SQLite with a corrupt database file.  The bug only comes up when very long string inputs (greater than 2 billion bytes  in length) are provided as arguments to a few specific C\-language interfaces,  and even then only under special circumstances. |
| [CVE\-2022\-24854](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24854) | Not a bug in SQLite | This CVE describes a bug in an application that uses SQLite, not in SQLite itself.  SQLite is doing everything correctly. The application grants users the ability to  run SQL statements, using SQLite, that can leak or change information that those users  should not normally have access to. This is purely an application bug. It does not  describe a malfunction or vulnerability in SQLite. |
| [CVE\-2022\-21227](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21227) | Not a bug in SQLite | This CVE describes a bug in a third\-party packages that provides a binding  for SQLite to Node.js. The bug reported is in the third\-party Node.js binding,  not in SQLite itself. Do not be confused by the use of the word "SQLite" in the  ambiguously\-worded CVE description. |
| [CVE\-2021\-45346](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45346) | Not a bug in SQLite | This CVE is misinformation. See the discussion around  [SQLite forum post 53de8864ba114bf](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/53de8864ba114bf6). |
| [CVE\-2021\-42169](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42169) | Not a bug in SQLite | This CVE has nothing whatsoever to do with SQLite. It is about a bug in  application that happens to use SQLite. Since SQLite is mentioned in the   CVE description, the CVE is included here to emphasize that  this is not an SQLite bug. |
| [CVE\-2021\-36690](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36690) | Not a bug in the core SQLite library | This bug is not in the SQLite core library, but rather in an  [experimental extension](https://www.sqlite.org/src/dir?ci=trunk&name=ext/expert) that is used to implement the  [.expert command](cli.html#expert) in the [CLI](cli.html). The code that contains the bug  does not appear in [standard SQLite builds](amalgamation.html), though it  is included in the [sqlite3\.exe command\-line tool](cli.html).  Applications must link against the extra source code files that  implement the extension and take other deliberate actions to  activate the extension before the troublesome code can be run.  For the rare application that uses the troublesome extension,  the consequence of this bug is that malicious SQL can cause a  NULL pointer deference and denial of service.

| [CVE\-2021\-28305](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28305) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is not a bug in SQLite. The bug is in a third\-party application that  uses SQLite. SQLite is mentioned by name in the CVE description,  however, so we have included the CVE in the list. |
| [CVE\-2021\-23404](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23404) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is not a bug in SQLite. The bug is in a third\-party application that  uses SQLite and includes "sqlite" in its name. This CVE is included on the  list because it mentions SQLite even though the bug has nothing to do  with SQLite. |
| [CVE\-2021\-20227](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20227) | [3\.34\.1](releaselog/3_34_1.html)(2021\-01\-20\) | Malicious SQL statement causes read\-after\-free. No harm can come of this  particular read\-after\-free instance, as far as anyone knows. The bug is  undetectable without a memory sanitizer. The CVE  claims that this bug is an RCE \- a Remote Code Execution  vulnerability, but that claim is incorrect.  The RCE claim is misinformation. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/30a4c323650cc949) |
| [CVE\-2021\-20223](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20223) | [3\.34\.0](releaselog/3_34_0.html)(2020\-12\-01\) | The problem identified by this CVE is not a vulnerability.   It is a malfunction. A coding error causes [FTS5](fts5.html)  to sometimes return inconsistent and incorrect results under obscure circumstances,  but no memory errors occur. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/b7b7bde9b7a03665) |
| [CVE\-2020\-15358](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15358) | [3\.32\.3](releaselog/3_32_3.html)(2020\-06\-18\) | Malicious SQL statement causes a read past the end of a heap buffer. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/8f157e8010b22af0) |
| [CVE\-2020\-13871](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13871) | [3\.32\.3](releaselog/3_32_3.html)(2020\-06\-18\) | Malicious SQL statement causes a read\-only use\-after\-free memory error. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/c8d3b9f0a750a529) |
| [CVE\-2020\-13632](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13632) | [3\.32\.0](releaselog/3_32_0.html)(2020\-05\-22\) | Malicious SQL statement causes a read of a NULL pointer in the  [matchinfo()](fts3.html#matchinfo) SQL function of the [FTS3](fts3.html) extension, resulting in  denial of service. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/a4dd148928ea65bd) |
| [CVE\-2020\-13631](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13631) | [3\.32\.0](releaselog/3_32_0.html)(2020\-05\-22\) | Malicious SQL statement (an ALTER TABLE that tries to rename a  [virtual table](vtab.html) into one of its own [shadow tables](vtab.html#xshadowname))  causes an infinite loop and denial of service. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/eca0ba2cf4c0fdf7) |
| [CVE\-2020\-13630](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13630) | [3\.32\.0](releaselog/3_32_0.html)(2020\-05\-22\) | Malicious SQL statement causes a read\-only use\-after\-free,  possibly resulting in an incorrect output from the [snippet()](fts3.html#snippet)  SQL function of the [FTS3](fts3.html) extension. There is no known  way to exfiltrate data or crash the application using this bug. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/0d69f76f0865f962) |
| [CVE\-2020\-13435](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13435) | [3\.32\.1](releaselog/3_32_1.html)(2020\-05\-25\) | Malicious SQL statement causes a read access to a NULL pointer and  denial of service. [(details)](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7a5279a25c57adf1) |
| [CVE\-2020\-13434](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13434) | [3\.32\.1](releaselog/3_32_1.html)(2020\-05\-25\) | Malicious SQL statement involving the printf() SQL function results  in an integer overflow which can overwrite the stack with over 2  billion bytes of 0x30 or 0x20 (ASCII '0' or ' ').  Even though this is a stack overwrite, there is no known way to  redirect control or otherwise escalate the level of harm.  This is a denial\-of\-service attack only. [(details)](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/23439ea582241138) |
| [CVE\-2020\-11656](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11656) | [3\.32\.0](releaselog/3_32_0.html)(2020\-05\-22\) | Malicious SQL statement causes read\-only use\-after\-free of memory allocation  if SQLite is compile with \-DSQLITE\_DEBUG. Does not affect release  builds. [(details)](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/4722bdab08cb1) |

This might enable a denial\-of\-service, if the   application has not taken appropriate and prudent steps  to limit the run\-time of SQL statements. This is not a vulnerability, as there  are countless perfectly valid SQL queries, especially queries involving  [recursive common table expressions](lang_with.html#recursivecte), that also run essentially forever.
