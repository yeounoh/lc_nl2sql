## 2\.3\. The SQLite Developer Policy Toward CVEs


SQLite developers fix all bugs in SQLite as soon as they are reported,
usually within a few hours. The fixes are immediately available on the
[public SQLite source tree](https://sqlite.org/src/timeline).
If a bug seems like it might cause problems for existing applications,
a new patch release for SQLite will be issued.



However, the SQLite developers do not track CVEs. There are 
various reasons for this:



1. The developers often do not find out about CVEs until long after the
bug is fixed. You can see this by the fact that many CVEs reference the
bug fix in their initial report.
2. CVEs are a low\-quality source of information about bugs in SQLite
that are likely to affect most applications.
3. Almost all bugs reported by CVEs are just bugs and not
true vulnerabilities. Claiming that they are vulnerabilities is
stretching the meaning of the word "vulnerability" and the SQLite
developers do not wish to participate in that deception.
4. The developers have no editorial influence on the content of CVEs,
and they do not like to be controlled by groups in which they have
no voice.
