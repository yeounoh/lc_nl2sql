# 2\. The "path" column of the dbstat virtual table



The "path" column describes the path taken from the 
root node of the btree structure to each page. The
"path" of the root node itself is '/'.
The "path" is NULL when "aggregate" is TRUE.

The "path" for the left\-most child page of the root of
a btree page is '/000/'. (Btrees store content ordered from left to right
so the pages to the left have smaller keys than the pages to the right.)
The next to left\-most child of the root page is '/001', and so on,
each sibling page identified by a 3\-digit hex value.
The children of the 451st left\-most sibling have paths such
as '/1c2/000/, '/1c2/001/' etc.

Overflow pages are specified by appending a '\+' character and a 
six\-digit hexadecimal value to the path to the cell they are linked
from. For example, the three overflow pages in a chain linked from 
the left\-most cell of the 450th child of the root page are identified
by the paths:




```
'/1c2/000+000000'         // First page in overflow chain
'/1c2/000+000001'         // Second page in overflow chain
'/1c2/000+000002'         // Third page in overflow chain

```


If the paths are sorted using the BINARY collation sequence, then
the overflow pages associated with a cell will appear earlier in the
sort\-order than its child page:




```
'/1c2/000/'               // Left-most child of 451st child of root

```
