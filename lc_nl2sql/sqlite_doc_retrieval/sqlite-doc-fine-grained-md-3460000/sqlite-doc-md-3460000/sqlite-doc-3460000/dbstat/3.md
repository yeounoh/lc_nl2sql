# 3\. Aggregated Data



Beginning with SQLite version 3\.31\.0 (2020\-01\-22\), the DBSTAT table
has a new [hidden column](vtab.html#hiddencol) named "aggregate", which if constrained to be
TRUE will cause DBSTAT to generate one row per btree in the database,
rather than one row per page. When running in aggregated mode, the 
"path", "pagetype", and "pgoffset" columns are always NULL and the
"pageno" column holds the number of pages in the entire btree, rather
than the number of the page that corresponds to the row.




The following table shows the meanings of the (non\-hidden) columns of
DBSTAT in both normal and aggregated mode:




> | Column | Normal meaning | Aggregate\-mode meaning |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | name | The name of the table or index that is implemented by the btree of the current row | |
> | path | See [description above](#dbstatpath) | Always NULL |
> | pageno | The page number of the database page for the current row | The total number of pages in the btree for the current row |
> | pagetype | 'leaf' or 'interior' | Always NULL |
> | ncell | Number of cells on the current page or btree | |
> | payload | Bytes of useful payload on the current page or btree | |
> | unused | Unused bytes of on the current page or btree | |
> | mx\_payload | The largest payload found anywhere in the current page or btree. | |
> | pgoffset | Byte offset to the start of the page | Always NULL |
> | pgsize | Total storage space used by the current page or btree. | |
