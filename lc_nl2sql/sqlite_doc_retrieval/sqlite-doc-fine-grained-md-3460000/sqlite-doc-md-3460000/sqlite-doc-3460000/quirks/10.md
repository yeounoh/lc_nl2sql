# 7\. Does Not Do Full Unicode Case Folding By Default



SQLite does not know about the upper\-case/lower\-case distinction
for all unicode characters. SQL functions like
upper() and lower() only work on ASCII characters. There are two
reasons for this:


1. Though stable now, when SQLite was first designed, the rules for
 unicode case folding were still in flux. That means that the
 behavior might have changed with each new unicode release, disrupting
 applications and corrupting indexes in the process.
2. The tables necessary to do full and proper unicode case folding are
 larger than the whole SQLite library.



Full unicode case folding is supported in SQLite if it is compiled
with the [\-DSQLITE\_ENABLE\_ICU](compile.html#enable_icu) option and linked against the
[International Components for Unicode](https://icu.unicode.org)
library.
