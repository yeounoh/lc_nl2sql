# 5\. PRIMARY KEYs Can Sometimes Contain NULLs



Usually (the exceptions are [INTEGER PRIMARY KEY](lang_createtable.html#rowid) tables and
[WITHOUT ROWID](withoutrowid.html) tables) a PRIMARY KEY in an SQLite table is really
the same as a UNIQUE constraint. Due to an historical oversight,
the column values of such a PRIMARY KEY are allowed to be NULL.
This is a bug, but by the time the problem was discovered there
where so many databases in circulation that depended on the bug that
the decision was made to support the buggy behavior moving forward.



The value of an [INTEGER PRIMARY KEY](lang_createtable.html#rowid) column must always be a
non\-NULL integer. The PRIMARY KEY columns of a [WITHOUT ROWID](withoutrowid.html)
table are also required to be non\-NULL.
