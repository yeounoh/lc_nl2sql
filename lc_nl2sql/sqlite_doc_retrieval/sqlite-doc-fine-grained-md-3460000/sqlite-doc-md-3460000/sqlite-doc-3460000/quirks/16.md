# 13\. SQLite Distinguishes Between Integer And Text Literals


SQLite says that the following query returns false:



```
SELECT 1='1';

```

It does this because an integer is not a string. 
Every other major SQL database engine says this is true, for reasons
that the creator of SQLite does not understand.
