# 2\. SQLite Is Embedded, Not Client\-Server



Whenever comparing SQLite to other SQL database engines like
SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle, it is important first of all
to realize that SQLite is not intended as a replacement or competitor to
any of those systems. SQLite is [serverless](serverless.html). There is no separate
server process that manages the database. An application interacts
with the database engine using function calls, not by sending messages
to a separate process or thread.




The fact that SQLite is embedded and [serverless](serverless.html) instead of being
client/server is a feature, not a bug.




Client/server databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and
others are an important component of modern systems.
These systems solve an important problem.
But SQLite solves a different problem.
Both SQLite and client/server databases have their role.
Developers who are comparing SQLite against other SQL database engines need
to clearly understand this distinction.
