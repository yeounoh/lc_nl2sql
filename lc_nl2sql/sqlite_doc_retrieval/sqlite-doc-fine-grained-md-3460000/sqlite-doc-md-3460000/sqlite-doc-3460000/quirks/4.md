## 3\.1\. No Separate BOOLEAN Datatype



Unlike most other SQL implementations,
SQLite does not have a separate BOOLEAN data type.
Instead, TRUE and FALSE are (normally) represented as integers 1 and 0,
respectively.
This does not seem to cause many problems, as we seldom get complaints
about it. But it is important to recognize.




Beginning with SQLite [version 3\.23\.0](releaselog/3_23_0.html) (2018\-04\-02\), SQLite also
recognizes TRUE and FALSE keywords as aliases for integer values 1 and 0,
respectively.
This provides better compatibility with other SQL implementations.
But for backwards compatibility, if there are columns named TRUE or
FALSE, then the keywords are treated as identifiers referencing those
columns, rather than BOOLEAN literals.
