## 3\.2\. No Separate DATETIME Datatype



SQLite has no DATETIME datatype.
Instead, dates and times can be stored in any of these ways:



* As a TEXT string in the ISO\-8601 format. Example: '2018\-04\-02 12:13:46'.
* As an INTEGER number of seconds since 1970 (also known as "unix time").
* As a REAL value that is the fractional
 [Julian day number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day).



The built\-in [date and time functions](lang_datefunc.html) of SQLite understand date/times in
all of the formats above, and can freely change between them.
Which format you use, is entirely up to your application.
