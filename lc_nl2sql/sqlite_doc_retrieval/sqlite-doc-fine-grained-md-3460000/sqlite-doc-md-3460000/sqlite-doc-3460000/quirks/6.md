## 3\.3\. The datatype is optional



Because SQLite is flexible and forgiving with regard to datatypes,
table columns can be created that have no specified datatype at all.
For example:



```
CREATE TABLE t1(a,b,c,d);

```

The table "t1" has four columns "a", "b", "c", and "d" that have
no particular datatype assigned. You can store anything you want in
any of those columns.
