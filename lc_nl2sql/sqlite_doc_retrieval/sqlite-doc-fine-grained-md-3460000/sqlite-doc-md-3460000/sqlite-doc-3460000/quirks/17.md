# 14\. SQLite Gets The Precedence Of Comma\-Joins Wrong


SQLite gives all join operators equal precedence and processes them
from left to right. But this is not quite correct. It should be that
comma\-joins have lower precedence than all others join operators.
In other words, a FROM clause like this:




> ... FROM a, b RIGHT JOIN c, d ...


This FROM clause should be parsed as follows:






JOIN





JOIN

D





RIGHT JOIN

A





B

C



But SQLite instead parses the FROM clause like this:






JOIN





RIGHT JOIN

D





JOIN

C





A

B



The problem can only makes a difference in the result when using
RIGHT OUTER JOIN or FULL OUTER JOIN in the same FROM clause with
comma\-joins, which rarely happens in practice. And
the problem can be easily overcome using parentheses in the FROM clause:




> ... FROM a, (b RIGHT JOIN c), d ...
