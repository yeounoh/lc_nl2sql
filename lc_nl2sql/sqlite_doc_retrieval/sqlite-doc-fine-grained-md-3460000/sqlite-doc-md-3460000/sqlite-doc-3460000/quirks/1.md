# 1\. Overview



The SQL language is a "standard".
Even so, no two SQL database engines work exactly alike.
Every SQL implementation has it own peculiarities and oddities,
and SQLite is no exception to this rule.




This document strives to highlight the principal differences
between SQLite and other SQL implementations, as an aid to developers
that are porting to or from SQLite or who are trying to build a
system that works across multiple database engines.




If you are an SQLite user whose has stumbled over some quirk of
SQLite that is not mentioned here, please let the developers know
by posting a brief message on the
[SQLite Forum](https://sqlite.org/forum/forum).
