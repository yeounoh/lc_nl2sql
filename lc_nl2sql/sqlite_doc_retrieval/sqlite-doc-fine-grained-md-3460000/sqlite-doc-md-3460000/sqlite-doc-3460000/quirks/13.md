# 10\. Dubious SQL Is Allowed Without Any Error Or Warning



The original implementation of SQLite sought to follow
[Postel's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) which
states in part "Be liberal in what you accept".
This used to be considered good design \- that a system would accept
dodgy inputs and try to do the best it could without complaining too much.
But lately, people have come to realize that it is sometimes better to
be strict in what you accept, so as to more easily find errors in the
input.
