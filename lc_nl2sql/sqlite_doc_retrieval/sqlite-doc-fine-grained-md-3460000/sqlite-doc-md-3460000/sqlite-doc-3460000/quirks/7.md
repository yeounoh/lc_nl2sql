# 4\. Foreign Key Enforcement Is Off By Default


SQLite has parsed foreign key constraints for time out of mind,
but added the ability to actually enforce those constraints much later,
with [version 3\.6\.19](releaselog/3_6_19.html) (2009\-10\-14\). By the time foreign key constraint
enforcement was added, there were already countless millions of databases
in circulation that contained foreign key constraints, some of which
were not correct. To avoid breaking those legacy databases, foreign key
constraint enforcement is turned off by default in SQLite.



Applications can activate foreign key enforcement at run\-time using
the [PRAGMA foreign\_keys](pragma.html#pragma_foreign_keys) statement. Or, foreign key enforcement can
be activated at compile\-time using the
[\-DSQLITE\_DEFAULT\_FOREIGN\_KEYS\=1](compile.html#default_foreign_keys) compile\-time option.
