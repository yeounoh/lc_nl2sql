# 11\. AUTOINCREMENT Does Not Work The Same As MySQL


The [AUTOINCREMENT](autoinc.html) feature in SQLite works differently than
it does in MySQL. This often causes confusion for people who
initially learned SQL on MySQL and then start using SQLite, and
expect the two systems to work identically.



See the [SQLite AUTOINCREMENT documentation](autoinc.html) for
detailed instructions on what AUTOINCREMENT does and does not do
in SQLite.
