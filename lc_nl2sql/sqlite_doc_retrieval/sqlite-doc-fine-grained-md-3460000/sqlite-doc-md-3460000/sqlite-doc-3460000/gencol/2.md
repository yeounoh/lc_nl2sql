# 2\. Syntax


Syntactically, generated columns are designated using a
"GENERATED ALWAYS" [column\-constraint](syntax/column-constraint.html). For example:




```
CREATE TABLE t1(
   a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   b INT,
   c TEXT,
   d INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (a*abs(b)) VIRTUAL,
   e TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (substr(c,b,b+1)) STORED
);

```

The statement above has three ordinary columns, "a" (the PRIMARY KEY),
"b", and "c", and two generated columns "d" and "e".



The "GENERATED ALWAYS" keywords at the beginning of the constraint
and the "VIRTUAL" or "STORED" keyword at the end are all optional.
Only the "AS" keyword and the parenthesized expression are required.
If the trailing "VIRTUAL" or "STORED" keyword is omitted, then
VIRTUAL is the default. Hence, the example statement above could
be simplified to just:




```
CREATE TABLE t1(
   a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   b INT,
   c TEXT,
   d INT AS (a*abs(b)),
   e TEXT AS (substr(c,b,b+1)) STORED
);

```
