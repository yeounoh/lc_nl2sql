## 2\.2\. Capabilities


1. Generated columns can have a datatype. SQLite attempts to transform
the result of the generating expression into that datatype using the
same [affinity](datatype3.html#affinity) rules as for ordinary columns.
2. Generated columns may have NOT NULL, CHECK, and UNIQUE constraints,
and foreign key constraints, just like ordinary columns.
3. Generated columns can participate in indexes, just like ordinary
columns.
4. The expression of a generated column can refer to any of the
other declared columns in the table, including other generated columns,
as long as the expression does not directly or indirectly refer back
to itself.
5. Generated columns can occur anywhere in the table definition. Generated
columns can be interspersed among ordinary columns. It is not necessary
to put generated columns at the end of the list of columns in the
table definition, as is shown in the examples above.
