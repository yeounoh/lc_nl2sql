## 2\.1\. VIRTUAL versus STORED columns


Generated columns can be either VIRTUAL or STORED. The value of
a VIRTUAL column is computed when read, whereas the value of a STORED
column is computed when the row is written. STORED columns take up space
in the database file, whereas VIRTUAL columns use more CPU cycles when
being read.



From the point of view of SQL, STORED and VIRTUAL columns are almost
exactly the same. Queries against either class of generated column
produce the same results. The only functional difference is that
one cannot add new STORED columns using the
[ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN](lang_altertable.html#altertabaddcol) command. Only VIRTUAL columns can be added
using ALTER TABLE.
