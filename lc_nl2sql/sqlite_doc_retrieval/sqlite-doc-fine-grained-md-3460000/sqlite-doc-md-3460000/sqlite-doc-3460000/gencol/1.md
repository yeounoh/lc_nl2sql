# 1\. Introduction


Generated columns (also sometimes called "computed columns")
are columns of a table whose values are a function of other columns
in the same row.
Generated columns can be read, but their values can not be directly
written. The only way to change the value of a generated column is to
modify the values of the other columns used to calculate
the generated column.
