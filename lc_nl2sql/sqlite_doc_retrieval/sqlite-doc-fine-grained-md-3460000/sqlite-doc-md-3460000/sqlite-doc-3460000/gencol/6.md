# 3\. Compatibility


Generated column support was added with SQLite version 3\.31\.0
(2020\-01\-22\). If an earlier version of SQLite attempts to read
a database file that contains a generated column in its schema, then
that earlier version will perceive the generated column syntax as an
error and will report that the database schema is corrupt.



To clarify: SQLite version 3\.31\.0 can read and write any database
created by any prior version of SQLite going back to 
SQLite 3\.0\.0 (2004\-06\-18\). And, earlier versions of SQLite,
prior to 3\.31\.0, can read and write databases created by SQLite
version 3\.31\.0 and later as long
as the database schema does not contain features, such as
generated columns, that are not understood by the earlier version.
Problems only arise if you create a new database that contains
generated columns, using SQLite version 3\.31\.0 or later, and then
try to read or write that database file using an earlier version of
SQLite that does not understand generated columns.
