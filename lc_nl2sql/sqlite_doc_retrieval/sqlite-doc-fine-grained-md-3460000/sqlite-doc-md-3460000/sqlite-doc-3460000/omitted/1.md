## SQL Features That SQLite Does Not Implement



SQLite implements most of the common features of SQL.
Rather than try to list all the features of SQL that SQLite does
support, it is much easier to list those that it does not.
Unsupported features of SQL are shown below.

[Quirks, Caveats, and Gotchas](quirks.html) of SQLite.



| **Complete ALTER TABLE support** | Only the RENAME TABLE, ADD COLUMN, RENAME COLUMN, and DROP COLUMN  variants of the ALTER TABLE command are supported. Other kinds of  ALTER TABLE operations such as  ALTER COLUMN, ADD CONSTRAINT, and so forth are omitted. | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Complete trigger support** | FOR EACH ROW triggers are supported but not FOR EACH STATEMENT  triggers. | |
| **Writing to VIEWs** | VIEWs in SQLite are read\-only. You may not execute a DELETE, INSERT, or  UPDATE statement on a view. But you can create a trigger  that fires on an attempt to DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE a view and do  what you need in the body of the trigger. | |
| **GRANT and REVOKE** | Since SQLite reads and writes an ordinary disk file, the  only access permissions that can be applied are the normal  file access permissions of the underlying operating system.  The GRANT and REVOKE commands commonly found on client/server  RDBMSes are not implemented because they would be meaningless  for an embedded database engine. | |
