## 3\.5\. Component table "context" values


 If the SELECT statement specified as part of the CREATE VIRTUAL 
TABLE command returns five columns, then the final column is used
for application context only. Swarmvtab does not use this value at
all, except that it is passed after \<database\-name\> to both
the openclose and missing functions, if specified. In other words,
instead of invoking the functions as described above, if the "context"
column is present swarmvtab instead invokes:




```
SELECT missing_udf(<database-name>, <context>);
SELECT openclose_udf(<database-name>, <context>, 0);
SELECT openclose_udf(<database-name>, <context>, 1);

```

as required.
