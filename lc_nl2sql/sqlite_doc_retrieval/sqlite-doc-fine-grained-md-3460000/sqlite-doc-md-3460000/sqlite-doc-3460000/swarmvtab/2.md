# 2\. Compiling and Using Swarmvtab


The code for the swarmvtab virtual table is found in the
ext/misc/unionvtab.c file of the main SQLite source tree. It may be compiled
into an SQLite [loadable extension](loadext.html) using a command like:




```
gcc -g -fPIC -shared unionvtab.c -o unionvtab.so

```

Alternatively, the unionvtab.c file may be compiled into the application. 
In this case, the following function should be invoked to register the
extension with each new database connection:




```
int sqlite3_unionvtab_init(sqlite3 *db, void*, void*);

```

 The first argument passed should be the database handle to register the
extension with. The second and third arguments should both be passed 0\.



 The source file and entry point are named for "unionvtab" instead of
"swarmvtab". Unionvtab is a [separately documented](unionvtab.html) virtual table 
that is bundled with swarmvtab.
