### 1\.3\.12\. Incremental vacuum settings


The two 4\-byte big\-endian integers at offsets 52 and 64 are used
to manage the [auto\_vacuum](pragma.html#pragma_auto_vacuum) and [incremental\_vacuum](pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum) modes. If
the integer at offset 52 is zero then pointer\-map (ptrmap) pages are
omitted from the database file and neither auto\_vacuum nor
incremental\_vacuum are supported. If the integer at offset 52 is
non\-zero then it is the page number of the largest root page in the
database file, the database file will contain ptrmap pages, and the
mode must be either auto\_vacuum or incremental\_vacuum. In this latter
case, the integer at offset 64 is true for incremental\_vacuum and
false for auto\_vacuum. If the integer at offset 52 is zero then
the integer at offset 64 must also be zero.
