### 1\.3\.2\. Page Size


The two\-byte value beginning at offset 16 determines the page size of 
the database. For SQLite versions 3\.7\.0\.1 (2010\-08\-04\)
and earlier, this value is 
interpreted as a big\-endian integer and must be a power of two between
512 and 32768, inclusive. Beginning with SQLite [version 3\.7\.1](releaselog/3_7_1.html)
(2010\-08\-23\), a page
size of 65536 bytes is supported. The value 65536 will not fit in a
two\-byte integer, so to specify a 65536\-byte page size, the value
at offset 16 is 0x00 0x01\.
This value can be interpreted as a big\-endian
1 and thought of as a magic number to represent the 65536 page size.
Or one can view the two\-byte field as a little endian number and say
that it represents the page size divided by 256\. These two 
interpretations of the page\-size field are equivalent.
