## 2\.3\. Representation Of SQL Tables


 Each ordinary SQL table in the database schema is represented on\-disk
by a table b\-tree. Each entry in the table b\-tree corresponds to a row
of the SQL table. The [rowid](lang_createtable.html#rowid) of the SQL table is the 64\-bit signed
integer key for each entry in the table b\-tree.


 The content of each SQL table row is stored in the database file by
first combining the values in the various columns into a byte array
in the record format, then storing that byte array as the payload in
an entry in the table b\-tree. The order of values in the record is
the same as the order of columns in the SQL table definition.
When an SQL table includes an
[INTEGER PRIMARY KEY](lang_createtable.html#rowid) column (which aliases the [rowid](lang_createtable.html#rowid)) then that
column appears in the record as a NULL value. SQLite will always use
the table b\-tree key rather than the NULL value when referencing the
[INTEGER PRIMARY KEY](lang_createtable.html#rowid) column.


 If the [affinity](datatype3.html#affinity) of a column is REAL and that column contains a
value that can be converted to an integer without loss of information
(if the value contains no fractional part and is not too large to be
represented as an integer) then the column may be stored in the record
as an integer. SQLite will convert the value back to floating
point when extracting it from the record.
