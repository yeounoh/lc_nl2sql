## 1\.1\. Hot Journals


If the application or
host computer crashes before the transaction completes, then the rollback
journal or write\-ahead log contains information needed 
to restore the main database file to a consistent state. When a rollback 
journal or write\-ahead log contains information necessary for recovering 
the state of the database, they are called a "hot journal" or "hot WAL file".
Hot journals and WAL files are only a factor during error recovery
scenarios and so are uncommon, but they are part of the state of an SQLite
database and so cannot be ignored. This document defines the format
of a rollback journal and the write\-ahead log file, but the focus is
on the main database file.
