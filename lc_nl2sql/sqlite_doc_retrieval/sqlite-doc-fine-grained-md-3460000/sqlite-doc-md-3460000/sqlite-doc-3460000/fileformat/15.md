### 1\.3\.11\. Suggested cache size


The 4\-byte big\-endian signed integer at offset 48 is the suggested
cache size in pages for the database file. The value is a suggestion
only and SQLite is under no obligation to honor it. The absolute value
of the integer is used as the suggested size. The suggested cache size
can be set using the [default\_cache\_size pragma](pragma.html#pragma_default_cache_size).
