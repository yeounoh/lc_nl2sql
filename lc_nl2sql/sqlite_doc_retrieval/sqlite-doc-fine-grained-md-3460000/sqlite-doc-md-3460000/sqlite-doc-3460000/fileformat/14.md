### 1\.3\.10\. Schema format number


The schema format number is a 4\-byte big\-endian integer at offset 44\.
The schema format number is similar to the file format read and write
version numbers at offsets 18 and 19 except that the schema format number
refers to the high\-level SQL formatting rather than the low\-level b\-tree
formatting. Four schema format numbers are currently defined:


1. Format 1 is understood by all versions of SQLite back to
[version 3\.0\.0](releaselog/3_0_0.html) (2004\-06\-18\).
2. Format 2 adds the ability of rows within the same table
to have a varying number of columns, in order to support the
[ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN](lang_altertable.html) functionality. Support for
reading and writing format 2 was added in SQLite 
[version 3\.1\.3](releaselog/3_1_3.html) on 2005\-02\-20\.
3. Format 3 adds the ability of extra columns added by
[ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN](lang_altertable.html) to have non\-NULL default
values. This capability was added in SQLite [version 3\.1\.4](releaselog/3_1_4.html)
on 2005\-03\-11\.
4. Format 4 causes SQLite to respect the
[DESC keyword](lang_createindex.html#descidx) on
index declarations. (The DESC keyword is ignored in indexes for 
formats 1, 2, and 3\.)
Format 4 also adds two new boolean record type values ([serial types](fileformat2.html#serialtype)
8 and 9\). Support for format 4 was added in SQLite 3\.3\.0 on
2006\-01\-10\.


New database files created by SQLite use format 4 by default.
The [legacy\_file\_format pragma](pragma.html#pragma_legacy_file_format) can be used to cause SQLite
to create new database files using format 1\.
The format version number can be made to default to 1 instead of 4 by
setting [SQLITE\_DEFAULT\_FILE\_FORMAT](compile.html#default_file_format)\=1 at compile\-time.
