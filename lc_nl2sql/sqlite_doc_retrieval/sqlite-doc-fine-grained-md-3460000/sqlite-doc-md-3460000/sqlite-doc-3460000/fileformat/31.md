## 2\.4\. Representation of WITHOUT ROWID Tables


If an SQL table is created using the "WITHOUT ROWID" clause at the
end of its CREATE TABLE statement, then that table is a [WITHOUT ROWID](withoutrowid.html)
table and uses a different on\-disk representation. A WITHOUT ROWID
table uses an index b\-tree rather than a table b\-tree for storage.
The key for each entry in the WITHOUT ROWID b\-tree is a record composed
of the columns of the PRIMARY KEY followed by all remaining columns of
the table. The primary key columns appear in the order that they were
declared in the PRIMARY KEY clause and the remaining columns appear in
the order they occur in the CREATE TABLE statement.



Hence, the content encoding for a WITHOUT ROWID table is the same
as the content encoding for an ordinary rowid table, except that the
order of the columns is rearranged so that PRIMARY KEY columns come
first, and the content is used as the key in an index b\-tree rather
than as the data in a table b\-tree.
The special encoding rules for columns with REAL affinity
apply to WITHOUT ROWID tables the same as they do with rowid tables.
