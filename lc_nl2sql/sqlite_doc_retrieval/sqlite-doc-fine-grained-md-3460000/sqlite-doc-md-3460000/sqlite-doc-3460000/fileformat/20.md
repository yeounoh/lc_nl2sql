### 1\.3\.16\. Write library version number and version\-valid\-for number


The 4\-byte big\-endian integer at offset 96 stores the 
[SQLITE\_VERSION\_NUMBER](c3ref/c_source_id.html) value for the SQLite library that most
recently modified the database file. The 4\-byte big\-endian integer at
offset 92 is the value of the [change counter](fileformat2.html#chngctr) when the version number
was stored. The integer at offset 92 indicates which transaction
the version number is valid for and is sometimes called the
"version\-valid\-for number".
