### 2\.6\.1\. Alternative Names For The Schema Table


The name "sqlite\_schema" does not appear anywhere in the file format.
That name is just a convention used by the database implementation.
Due to historical and operational considerations, the
"sqlite\_schema" table can also sometimes be called by one of the
following aliases:



1. sqlite\_master
2. sqlite\_temp\_schema
3. sqlite\_temp\_master


Because the name of the schema table does not appear anywhere in
the file format, the meaning of the database file is not changed if
the application chooses to refer to the schema table by one of
these alternative names.
