### 1\.3\.13\. Text encoding


The 4\-byte big\-endian integer at offset 56 determines the encoding
used for all text strings stored in the database. 
A value of 1 means UTF\-8\.
A value of 2 means UTF\-16le.
A value of 3 means UTF\-16be.
No other values are allowed.
The sqlite3\.h header file defines C\-preprocessor macros SQLITE\_UTF8 as 1,
SQLITE\_UTF16LE as 2, and SQLITE\_UTF16BE as 3, to use in place of
the numeric codes for the text encoding.
