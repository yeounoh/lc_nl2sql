### 1\.3\.7\. In\-header database size



The 4\-byte big\-endian integer at offset 28 into the header 
stores the size of the database file in pages. If this in\-header
datasize size is not valid (see the next paragraph), then the database 
size is computed by looking
at the actual size of the database file. Older versions of SQLite
ignored the in\-header database size and used the actual file size
exclusively. Newer versions of SQLite use the in\-header database
size if it is available but fall back to the actual file size if
the in\-header database size is not valid.


The in\-header database size is only considered to be valid if
it is non\-zero and if the 4\-byte [change counter](fileformat2.html#chngctr) at offset 24
exactly matches the 4\-byte [version\-valid\-for number](fileformat2.html#validfor) at offset 92\.
The in\-header database size is always valid 
when the database is only modified using recent versions of SQLite,
versions 3\.7\.0 (2010\-07\-21\) and later.
If a legacy version of SQLite writes to the database, it will not
know to update the in\-header database size and so the in\-header
database size could be incorrect. But legacy versions of SQLite
will also leave the version\-valid\-for number at offset 92 unchanged
so it will not match the change\-counter. Hence, invalid in\-header
database sizes can be detected (and ignored) by observing when
the change\-counter does not match the version\-valid\-for number.
