### 1\.3\.15\. Application ID


The 4\-byte big\-endian integer at offset 68 is an "Application ID" that
can be set by the [PRAGMA application\_id](pragma.html#pragma_application_id) command in order to identify the
database as belonging to or associated with a particular application.
The application ID is intended for database files used as an
[application file\-format](appfileformat.html). The application ID can be used by utilities 
such as [file(1\)](http://www.darwinsys.com/file/) to determine the specific
file type rather than just reporting "SQLite3 Database". A list of
assigned application IDs can be seen by consulting the
[magic.txt](https://www.sqlite.org/src/artifact?ci=trunk&filename=magic.txt)
file in the SQLite source repository.
