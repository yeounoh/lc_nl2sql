### 1\.3\.3\. File format version numbers


The file format write version and file format read version at offsets
18 and 19 are intended to allow for enhancements of the file format
in future versions of SQLite. In current versions of SQLite, both of
these values are 1 for rollback journalling modes and 2 for [WAL](wal.html)
journalling mode. If a version of SQLite coded to the current
file format specification encounters a database file where the read
version is 1 or 2 but the write version is greater than 2, then the database
file must be treated as read\-only. If a database file with a read version
greater than 2 is encountered, then that database cannot be read or written.
