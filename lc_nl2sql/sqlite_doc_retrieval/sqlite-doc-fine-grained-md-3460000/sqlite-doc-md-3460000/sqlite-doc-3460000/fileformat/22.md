## 1\.4\. The Lock\-Byte Page


The lock\-byte page is the single page of the database file
that contains the bytes at offsets between 1073741824 and 1073742335,
inclusive. A database file that is less than or equal to 1073741824 bytes 
in size contains no lock\-byte page. A database file larger than
1073741824 contains exactly one lock\-byte page.



The lock\-byte page is set aside for use by the operating\-system specific
[VFS](vfs.html) implementation in implementing the database file locking primitives.
SQLite does not use the lock\-byte page. The SQLite core 
will never read or write the lock\-byte page,
though operating\-system specific [VFS](vfs.html) 
implementations may choose to read or write bytes on the lock\-byte 
page according to the 
needs and proclivities of the underlying system. The unix and win32
[VFS](vfs.html) implementations that come built into SQLite do not write to the
lock\-byte page, but third\-party VFS implementations for
other operating systems might.


The lock\-byte page arose from the need to support Win95 which was the
predominant operating system when this file format was designed and which 
only supported mandatory file locking. All modern operating systems that
we know of support advisory file locking, and so the lock\-byte page is
not really needed any more, but is retained for backwards compatibility.
