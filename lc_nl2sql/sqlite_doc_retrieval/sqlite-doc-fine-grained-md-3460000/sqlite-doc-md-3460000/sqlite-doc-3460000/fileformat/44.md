# 4\. The Write\-Ahead Log


Beginning with [version 3\.7\.0](releaselog/3_7_0.html) (2010\-07\-21\), 
SQLite supports a new transaction
control mechanism called "[write\-ahead log](wal.html)" or "[WAL](wal.html)".
When a database is in WAL mode, all connections to that database must
use the WAL. A particular database will use either a rollback journal
or a WAL, but not both at the same time.
The WAL is always located in the same directory as the database
file and has the same name as the database file but with the string
"\-wal" appended.
