### 1\.3\.9\. Schema cookie


The schema cookie is a 4\-byte big\-endian integer at offset 40
that is incremented whenever the database schema changes. A 
prepared statement is compiled against a specific version of the
database schema. When the database schema changes, the statement
must be reprepared. When a prepared statement runs, it first checks
the schema cookie to ensure the value is the same as when the statement
was prepared and if the schema cookie has changed, the statement either
automatically reprepares and reruns or it aborts with an [SQLITE\_SCHEMA](rescode.html#schema) 
error.
