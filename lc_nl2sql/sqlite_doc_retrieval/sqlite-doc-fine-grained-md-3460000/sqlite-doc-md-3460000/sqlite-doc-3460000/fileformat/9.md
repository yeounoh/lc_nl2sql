### 1\.3\.5\. Payload fractions


The maximum and minimum embedded payload fractions and the leaf
payload fraction values must be 64, 32, and 32\. These values were
originally intended to be tunable parameters that could be used to
modify the storage format of the b\-tree algorithm. However, that
functionality is not supported and there are no current plans to add
support in the future. Hence, these three bytes are fixed at the
values specified.
