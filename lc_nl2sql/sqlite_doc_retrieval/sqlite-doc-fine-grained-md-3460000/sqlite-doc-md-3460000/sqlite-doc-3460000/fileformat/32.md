### 2\.4\.1\. Suppression of redundant columns in the PRIMARY KEY
 of WITHOUT ROWID tables


If the PRIMARY KEY of a WITHOUT ROWID tables uses the same columns
with the same collating sequence more than once, then the second and
subsequent occurrences of that column in the PRIMARY KEY definition are
ignored. For example, the following CREATE TABLE statements all specify
the same table, which will have the exact same representation on disk:




> ```
> 
> CREATE TABLE t1(a,b,c,d,PRIMARY KEY(a,c)) WITHOUT ROWID;
> CREATE TABLE t1(a,b,c,d,PRIMARY KEY(a,c,a,c)) WITHOUT ROWID;
> CREATE TABLE t1(a,b,c,d,PRIMARY KEY(a,A,a,C)) WITHOUT ROWID;
> CREATE TABLE t1(a,b,c,d,PRIMARY KEY(a,a,a,a,c)) WITHOUT ROWID;
> 
> ```


The first example above is the preferred definition of the table,
of course. All of the examples create a WITHOUT ROWID table with
two PRIMARY KEY columns, "a" and "c", in that order, followed by
two data columns "b" and "d", also in that order.
