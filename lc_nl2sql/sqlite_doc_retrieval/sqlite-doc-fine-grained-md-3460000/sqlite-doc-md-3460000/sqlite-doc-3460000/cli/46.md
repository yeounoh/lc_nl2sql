## 23\.3\. The \-\-no\-utf8 and \-\-utf8 command\-line options


On the Windows platform, when the console is used for input or output,
translation is required between character encoding available from or sent to
the console and the CLI's internal, UTF\-8 text representation. Past versions
of the CLI accepted these options to enable or disable use of a translation
that relied upon a Windows console feature whereby it could be made to
produce or accept UTF\-8 on modern versions of the OS.


Present CLI versions (3\.44\.1 or later) do console I/O by reading or writing
UTF\-16 from/to the Windows console APIs. Because this operates correctly even
on Windows versions going back to Window 2000, there is no longer any need
for these options. They are still accepted, but without effect.


In all cases, non\-console text I/O is UTF\-8 encoded.


On non\-Windows platforms, these options are also ignored.
