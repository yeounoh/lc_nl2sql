# 9\. Accessing ZIP Archives As Database Files


In addition to reading and writing SQLite database files,
the **sqlite3** program will also read and write ZIP archives.
Simply specify a ZIP archive filename in place of an SQLite database
filename on the initial command line, or in the ".open" command,
and **sqlite3** will automatically detect that the file is a
ZIP archive instead of an SQLite database and will open it as such.
This works regardless of file suffix. So you can open JAR, DOCX,
and ODP files and any other file format that is really a ZIP
archive and SQLite will read it for you.



A ZIP archive appears to be a database containing a single table
with the following schema:




```
CREATE TABLE zip(
  name,     // Name of the file
  mode,     // Unix-style file permissions
  mtime,    // Timestamp, seconds since 1970
  sz,       // File size after decompression
  rawdata,  // Raw compressed file data
  data,     // Uncompressed file content
  method    // ZIP compression method code
);

```

So, for example, if you wanted to see the compression efficiency
(expressed as the size of the compressed content relative to the
original uncompressed file size) for all files in the ZIP archive,
sorted from most compressed to least compressed, you could run a
query like this:




```
sqlite> SELECT name, (100.0*length(rawdata))/sz FROM zip ORDER BY 2;

```

Or using [file I/O functions](cli.html#fileio), you can extract elements of the
ZIP archive:




```
sqlite> SELECT writefile(name,content) FROM zip
   ...> WHERE name LIKE 'docProps/%';

```
