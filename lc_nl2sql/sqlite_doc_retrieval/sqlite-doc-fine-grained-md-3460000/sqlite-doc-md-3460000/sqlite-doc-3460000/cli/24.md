# 12\. Loading Extensions


You can add new custom [application\-defined SQL functions](appfunc.html),
[collating sequences](datatype3.html#collation), [virtual tables](vtab.html), and [VFSes](vfs.html) to the command\-line
shell at run\-time using the ".load" command. First, build the
extension as a DLL or shared library (as described in the
[Run\-Time Loadable Extensions](loadext.html) document) then type:




```
sqlite> .load /path/to/my_extension

```

Note that SQLite automatically adds the appropriate extension suffix
(".dll" on windows, ".dylib" on Mac, ".so" on most other unixes) to the
extension filename. It is generally a good idea to specify the full
pathname of the extension.



SQLite computes the entry point for the extension based on the extension
filename. To override this choice, simply add the name of the extension
as a second argument to the ".load" command.



Source code for several useful extensions can be found in the
[ext/misc](https://www.sqlite.org/src/tree?name=ext/misc&ci=trunk)
subdirectory of the SQLite source tree. You can use these extensions
as\-is, or as a basis for creating your own custom extensions to address
your own particular needs.
