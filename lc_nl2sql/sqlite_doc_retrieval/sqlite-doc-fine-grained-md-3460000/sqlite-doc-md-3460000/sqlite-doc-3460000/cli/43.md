## 23\.1\. The \-\-safe command\-line option


The \-\-safe command\-line option attempts to disable all features of the CLI that
might cause any changes to the host computer other than changes to the specific database
file named on the command\-line. The idea is that if you receive a large SQL script
from an unknown or untrusted source, you can run that script to see what it does without
risking an exploit by using the \-\-safe option. The \-\-safe option disables (among other
things):



* The [.open command](cli.html#dotopen), unless the \-\-hexdb option is used or the filename is ":memory:".
 This prevents the script from reading or writing any database files not named on
 the original command\-line.
* The [ATTACH](lang_attach.html) SQL command.
* SQL functions that have potentially harmful side\-effects, such as
 edit(), fts3\_tokenizer(), load\_extension(), readfile() and writefile().
* The [.archive command](cli.html#sqlar).
* The .backup and .save commands.
* The [.import command](cli.html#csv).
* The [.load command](cli.html#dotload).
* The .log command.
* The .shell and .system commands.
* The .excel, .once and .output commands.
* Other commands that can have deleterious side effects.


Basically, any feature of the CLI that reads or writes from a file on disk other
than the main database file is disabled.
