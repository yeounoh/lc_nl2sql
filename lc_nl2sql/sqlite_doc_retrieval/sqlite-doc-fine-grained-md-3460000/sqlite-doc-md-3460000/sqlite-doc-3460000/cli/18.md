### 8\.6\.1\.  Export to Excel


To simplify export to a spreadsheet, the CLI provides the
".excel" command which captures the output of a single query and sends
that output to the default spreadsheet program on the host computer.
Use it like this:




```
sqlite> .excel
sqlite> SELECT * FROM tab;

```


The command above writes the output of the query as CSV into a temporary
file, invokes the default handler for CSV files (usually the preferred
spreadsheet program such as Excel or LibreOffice), then deletes the
temporary file. This is essentially a short\-hand method of doing
the sequence of ".csv", ".once", and ".system" commands described above.




The ".excel" command is really an alias for ".once \-x". The \-x option
to .once causes it to writes results as CSV into a temporary file that
is named with a ".csv" suffix, then invoke the systems default handler
for CSV files.




There is also a ".once \-e" command which works similarly, except that
it names the temporary file with a ".txt" suffix so that the default
text editor for the system will be invoked, instead of the default
spreadsheet.
