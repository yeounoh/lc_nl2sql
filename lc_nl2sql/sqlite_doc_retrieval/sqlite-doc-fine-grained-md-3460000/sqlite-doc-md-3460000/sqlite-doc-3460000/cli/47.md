# 24\. Compiling the sqlite3 program from sources



To compile the command\-line shell on unix systems and on Windows with MinGW,
the usual configure\-make command works:




```
sh configure; make

```


The configure\-make works whether you are building from the canonical sources
from the source tree, or from an amalgamated bundle. There are few
dependencies. When building from canonical sources, a working
[tclsh](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.3/UserCmd/tclsh.htm) is required.
If using an amalgamation bundle, all the preprocessing work normally
done by tclsh will have already been carried out and only normal build
tools are required.




A working [zlib compression library](https://zlib.net) is
needed in order for the [.archive command](cli.html#sqlar) to operate.




On Windows with MSVC, use nmake with the Makefile.msc:




```
nmake /f Makefile.msc

```


For correct operation of the [.archive command](cli.html#sqlar), make a copy of the
[zlib source code](https://zlib.net) into the compat/zlib subdirectory
of the source tree and compile this way:




```
nmake /f Makefile.msc USE_ZLIB=1

```
