## 15\.3\.  SQLite Archive List Command


List the contents of the archive. If no arguments are specified, then all
files are listed. Otherwise, only those which match the arguments,
as affected by the \-\-glob option, are listed. Currently,
the \-\-verbose option does not change the behaviour of this command. That may
change in the future.




```
-- List contents of archive in current "main" db..
.ar --list

```
