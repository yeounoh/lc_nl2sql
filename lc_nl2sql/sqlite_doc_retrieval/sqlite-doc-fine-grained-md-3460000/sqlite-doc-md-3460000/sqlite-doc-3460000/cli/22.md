# 10\. Converting An Entire Database To A Text File


Use the ".dump" command to convert the entire contents of a
database into a single UTF\-8 text file. This file can be converted
back into a database by piping it back into **sqlite3**.


A good way to make an archival copy of a database is this:



```
$ sqlite3 ex1 .dump | gzip -c >ex1.dump.gz

```

This generates a file named **ex1\.dump.gz** that contains everything
you need to reconstruct the database at a later time, or on another
machine. To reconstruct the database, just type:



```
$ zcat ex1.dump.gz | sqlite3 ex2

```

The text format is pure SQL so you
can also use the .dump command to export an SQLite database
into other popular SQL database engines. Like this:



```
$ createdb ex2
$ sqlite3 ex1 .dump | psql ex2

```
