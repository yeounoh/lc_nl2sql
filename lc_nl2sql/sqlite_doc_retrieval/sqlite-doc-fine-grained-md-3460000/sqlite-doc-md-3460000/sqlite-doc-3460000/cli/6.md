## 4\.2\. Dot\-command arguments


The arguments passed to dot\-commands are parsed from the command tail,
 per these rules:


1. The trailing newline and any other trailing whitespace is discarded;
2. Whitespace immediately following the dot\-command name, or any argument
 input end bound is discarded;
3. An argument input begins with any non\-whitespace character;
4. An argument input ends with a character which
 depends upon its leading character thusly:
* for a leading single\-quote ('), a single\-quote acts
 as the end delimiter;
* for a leading double\-quote ("), an unescaped double\-quote
 acts as the end delimiter;
* for any other leading character, the end delimiter is
 any whitespace; and
* the command tail end acts as the end delimiter for any argument;

6. Within a double\-quoted argument input, a backslash\-escaped double\-quote
 is part of the argument rather than its terminating quote;
7. Within a double\-quoted argument, traditional C\-string literal, backslash
 escape sequence translation is done; and
8. Argument input delimiters (the bounding quotes or whitespace)
 are discarded to yield the passed argument.
