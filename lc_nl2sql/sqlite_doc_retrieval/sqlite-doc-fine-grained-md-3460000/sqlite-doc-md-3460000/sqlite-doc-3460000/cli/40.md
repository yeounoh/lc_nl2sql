# 21\. Using sqlite3 in a shell script



One way to use sqlite3 in a shell script is to use "echo" or
"cat" to generate a sequence of commands in a file, then invoke sqlite3
while redirecting input from the generated command file. This
works fine and is appropriate in many circumstances. But as
an added convenience, sqlite3 allows a single SQL command to be
entered on the command line as a second argument after the
database name. When the sqlite3 program is launched with two
arguments, the second argument is passed to the SQLite library
for processing, the query results are printed on standard output
in list mode, and the program exits. This mechanism is designed
to make sqlite3 easy to use in conjunction with programs like
"awk". For example:



```
$ sqlite3 ex1 'select * from tbl1' \
>  | awk '{printf "<tr><td>%s<td>%s\n",$1,$2 }'
<tr><td>hello<td>10
<tr><td>goodbye<td>20
$

```
