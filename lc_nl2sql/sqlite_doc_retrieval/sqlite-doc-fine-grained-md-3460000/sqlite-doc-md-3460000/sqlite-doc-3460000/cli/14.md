## 8\.3\. File I/O Functions


The command\-line shell adds two [application\-defined SQL functions](appfunc.html) that
facilitate reading content from a file into a table column, and writing the
content of a column into a file, respectively.



The readfile(X) SQL function reads the entire content of the file named
X and returns that content as a BLOB. This can be used to load content into
a table. For example:




```
sqlite> CREATE TABLE images(name TEXT, type TEXT, img BLOB);
sqlite> INSERT INTO images(name,type,img)
   ...>   VALUES('icon','jpeg',readfile('icon.jpg'));

```

The writefile(X,Y) SQL function write the blob Y into the file named X
and returns the number of bytes written. Use this function to extract
the content of a single table column into a file. For example:




```
sqlite> SELECT writefile('icon.jpg',img) FROM images WHERE name='icon';

```

Note that the readfile(X) and writefile(X,Y) functions are extension
functions and are not built into the core SQLite library. These routines
are available as a [loadable extension](loadext.html) in the
[ext/misc/fileio.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/artifact?ci=trunk&filename=ext/misc/fileio.c)
source file in the [SQLite source code repositories](download.html#srctree).
