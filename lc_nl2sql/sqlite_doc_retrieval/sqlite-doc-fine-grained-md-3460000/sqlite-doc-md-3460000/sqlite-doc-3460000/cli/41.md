# 22\. Marking The End Of An SQL Statement



SQLite commands are normally terminated by a semicolon. In the CLI
you can also use the word "GO" (case\-insensitive) or a slash character
"/" on a line by itself to end a command. These are used by SQL Server
and Oracle, respectively, and are supported by the SQLite CLI for
compatibility. These won't work in **sqlite3\_exec()**,
because the CLI translates these inputs into a semicolon before passing
them down into the SQLite core.
