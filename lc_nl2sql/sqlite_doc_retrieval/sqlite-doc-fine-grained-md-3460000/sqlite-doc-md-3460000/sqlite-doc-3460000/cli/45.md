## 23\.2\. The \-\-unsafe\-testing command\-line option


The \-\-unsafe\-testing command\-line option supports use of the CLI for
internal testing of the SQLite library. It is not needed or useful for using
the CLI as a utility for creating, modifying or querying SQLite databases.
Its intended use is to permit scripted testing with direct schema changes,
defensive measures defeated, and certain special\-purpose, undocumented,
test\-oriented dot\-commands enabled.



Misbehavior which requires use of the \-\-unsafe\-testing option to be induced
will generally not be considered a bug for that reason alone. CLI behavior
with \-\-unsafe\-testing is not supported or defined.
