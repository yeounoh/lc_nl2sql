### 8\.6\.2\.  Export to TSV (tab separated values)



Exporting to pure TSV, without any field quoting, can be done by
entering ".mode tabs" before running a query. However, the output
will not be read correctly in tabs mode by the ".import" command
if it contains doublequote characters. To get TSV quoted per
RFC 4180 so that it can be input in tabs mode with ".import",
first enter ".mode csv", then enter '.separator "\\t"'
before running a query.
