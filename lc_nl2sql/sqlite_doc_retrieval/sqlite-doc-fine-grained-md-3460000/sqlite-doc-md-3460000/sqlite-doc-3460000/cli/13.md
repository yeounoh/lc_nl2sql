## 8\.2\. Reading SQL from a file


In interactive mode, sqlite3 reads input text (either SQL statements
or [dot\-commands](cli.html#dotcmd)) from the keyboard. You can also redirect input from
a file when you launch sqlite3, of course, but then you do not have the
ability to interact with the program. Sometimes it is useful to run an
SQL script contained in a file entering other commands from the command\-line.
For this, the ".read" dot\-command is provided.



The ".read" command takes a single argument which is (usually) the name
of a file from which to read input text.




```
sqlite> .read myscript.sql

```

The ".read" command temporarily stops reading from the keyboard and instead
takes its input from the file named. Upon reaching the end of the file,
input reverts back to the keyboard. The script file may contain dot\-commands,
just like ordinary interactive input.



If the argument to ".read" begins with the "\|" character, then instead of
opening the argument as a file, it runs the argument (without the leading "\|")
as a command, then uses the output of that command as its input. Thus, if you
have a script that generates SQL, you can execute that SQL directly using
a command similar to the following:




```
sqlite> .read |myscript.bat

```
