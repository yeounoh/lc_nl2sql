### 23\.1\.1\. Bypassing \-\-safe restrictions for specific commands


If the "\-\-nonce NONCE" option is also included on the command\-line, for some
large and arbitrary NONCE string, then the ".nonce NONCE" command (with the
same large nonce string) will permit the next SQL statement or dot\-command
to bypass the \-\-safe restrictions.



Suppose you want to run a suspicious script and the script requires one or
two of the features that \-\-safe normally disables. For example, suppose it
needs to ATTACH one additional database. Or suppose the script needs to load
a specific extension. This can be accomplished by preceding the (carefully
audited) ATTACH statement or the ".load" command with an appropriate ".nonce"
command and supplying the same nonce value using the "\-\-nonce" command\-line
option. Those specific commands will then be allowed to execute normally,
but all other unsafe commands will still be restricted.



The use of ".nonce" is dangerous in the sense that a mistake can allow a
hostile script to damage your system. Therefore, use ".nonce" carefully,
sparingly, and as a last resort when there are no other ways to get a
script to run under \-\-safe mode.
