## 15\.2\.  SQLite Archive Extract Command


Extract files from the archive (either to the current working directory or
to the directory specified by a \-\-directory option).
Files or directories whose names match the arguments,
as affected by the \-\-glob option, are extracted.
Or, if no arguments follow the options, all files and directories are extracted.
Any specified directories are extracted recursively. It is an error if any
specified names or match patterns cannot be found in the archive.




```
-- Extract all files from the archive in the current "main" db to the
-- current working directory. List files as they are extracted. 
.ar --extract --verbose

-- Extract file "file1" from archive "ar.db" to directory "dir1".
.ar fCx ar.db dir1 file1

-- Extract files with ".h" extension to directory "headers".
.ar -gCx headers *.h

```
