## 4\.1\. Line Structure


The CLI's input is parsed into a sequence consisting of:
 

* SQL statements;
* dot\-commands; or
* CLI comments


SQL statements are free\-form, and can be spread across multiple lines,
 with whitespace or SQL comments embedded anywhere.
 They are terminated by either a ';' character at the end of an input line,
 or a '/' character or the word "go" on a line by itself.
 When not at the end of an input line, the ';' character
 acts to separate SQL statements.
 Trailing whitespace is ignored for purposes of termination.


A dot\-command has a more restrictive structure:


* It must begin with its "." at the left margin
 with no preceding whitespace.
* It must be entirely contained on a single input line.
* It cannot occur in the middle of an ordinary SQL
 statement. In other words, it cannot occur at a
 continuation prompt.
* There is no comment syntax for dot\-commands.


The CLI also accepts whole\-line comments that
begin with a '\#' character and extend to the end of the line.
There can be no with whitespace prior to the '\#'.
