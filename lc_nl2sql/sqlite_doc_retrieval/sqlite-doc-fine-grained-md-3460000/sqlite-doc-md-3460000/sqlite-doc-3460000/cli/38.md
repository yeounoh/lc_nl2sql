# 19\. Miscellaneous Extension Features



The CLI is built with several SQLite extensions that are not
included with the SQLite library. A few add features
not described in the preceding sections, namely:


* the UINT collating sequence which treats
unsigned integers embedded in text according to
their value, along with other text, for ordering;
* decimal arithmetic as provided by the [decimal extension](floatingpoint.html#decext);
* the [generate\_series](series.html)() table\-valued function;
* the base64() and base85() functions which encode a
blob to base64 or base85 text or decode the same to a blob; and
* support for POSIX extended regular expressions
bound to the [REGEXP](lang_expr.html#regexp) operator.
