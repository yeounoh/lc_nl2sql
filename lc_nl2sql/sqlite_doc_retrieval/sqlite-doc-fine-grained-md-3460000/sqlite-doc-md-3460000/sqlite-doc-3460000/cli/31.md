## 15\.4\.  SQLite Archive Insert And Update Commands


 The \-\-update and \-\-insert commands work like \-\-create command, except that
they do not delete the current archive before commencing. New versions of
files silently replace existing files with the same names, but otherwise
the initial contents of the archive (if any) remain intact.



 For the \-\-insert command, all files listed are inserted into the archive.
For the \-\-update command, files are only inserted if they do not previously
exist in the archive, or if their "mtime" or "mode" is different from what
is currently in the archive.



 Compatibility node: Prior to SQLite version 3\.28\.0 (2019\-04\-16\) only
the \-\-update option was supported but that option worked like \-\-insert in that
it always reinserted every file regardless of whether or not it had changed.
