## 8\.6\. Export to CSV


To export an SQLite table (or part of a table) as CSV, simply set
the "mode" to "csv" and then run a query to extract the desired rows
of the table. The output will formatted as CSV per RFC 4180\.




```
sqlite> .headers on
sqlite> .mode csv
sqlite> .once c:/work/dataout.csv
sqlite> SELECT * FROM tab1;
sqlite> .system c:/work/dataout.csv

```

In the example above, the ".headers on" line causes column labels to
be printed as the first row of output. This means that the first row of
the resulting CSV file will contain column labels. If column labels are
not desired, set ".headers off" instead. (The ".headers off" setting is
the default and can be omitted if the headers have not been previously
turned on.)



The line ".once *FILENAME*" causes all query output to go into
the named file instead of being printed on the console. In the example
above, that line causes the CSV content to be written into a file named
"C:/work/dataout.csv".



The final line of the example (the ".system c:/work/dataout.csv")
has the same effect as double\-clicking on the c:/work/dataout.csv file
in windows. This will typically bring up a spreadsheet program to display
the CSV file.



That command only works as written on Windows.
The equivalent line on a Mac would be:




```
sqlite> .system open dataout.csv

```

On Linux and other unix systems you will need to enter something like:





```
sqlite> .system xdg-open dataout.csv

```
