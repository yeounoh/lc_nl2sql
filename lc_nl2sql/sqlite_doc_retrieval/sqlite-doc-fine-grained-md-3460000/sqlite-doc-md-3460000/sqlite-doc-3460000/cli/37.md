# 18\. Working With Multiple Database Connections



Beginning with version 3\.37\.0 (2021\-11\-27\), the CLI has the ability to
hold multiple [database connections](c3ref/sqlite3.html) open at once. Only one database connection
is active at a time. The inactive connections are still open but are idle.




Use the ".connection" dot\-command (often abbreviated as just ".conn") to see a
list of database connections and an indication of which one is currently active.
Each database connection is identified by an integer between 0 and 9\. (There
can be at most 10 simultaneously open connections.) Change to another database
connection, creating it if it does not already exist, by typing the ".conn"
command followed by its number. Close a database connection by typing
".conn close N" where N is the connection number.




Though the underlying SQLite database connections are completely independent
of one another, many of the CLI settings, such as the output format, are
shared across all database connections. Thus, changing the [output mode](cli.html#dotmode) in
one connection will change it in them all. On the other hand, some
[dot\-commands](cli.html#dotcmd) such as [.open](cli.html#dotopen) only affect the current connection.
