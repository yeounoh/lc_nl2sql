## 15\.6\.  Operations On ZIP Archives


If FILE is a ZIP archive rather than an SQLite Archive, the ".archive"
command and the "\-A" command\-line option still work. This is accomplished
using of the [zipfile](zipfile.html) extension.
Hence, the following commands are roughly equivalent,
differing only in output formatting:





| Traditional Command | Equivalent sqlite3\.exe Command |
| --- | --- |
| unzip archive.zip | sqlite3 \-Axf archive.zip |
| unzip \-l archive.zip | sqlite3 \-Atvf archive.zip |
| zip \-r archive2\.zip dir | sqlite3 \-Acf archive2\.zip dir |
