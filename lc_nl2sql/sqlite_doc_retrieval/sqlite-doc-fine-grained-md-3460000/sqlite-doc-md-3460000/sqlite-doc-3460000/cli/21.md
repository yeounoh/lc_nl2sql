## 9\.1\. How ZIP archive access is implemented


The command\-line shell uses the [Zipfile virtual table](zipfile.html) to
access ZIP archives. You can see this by running the ".schema"
command when a ZIP archive is open:




```
sqlite> .schema
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE zip USING zipfile('document.docx')
/* zip(name,mode,mtime,sz,rawdata,data,method) */;

```

When opening a file, if the command\-line client discovers that the
file is ZIP archive instead of an SQLite database, it actually opens
an [in\-memory database](inmemorydb.html) and then in that in\-memory database it creates
an instance of the [Zipfile virtual table](zipfile.html) that is attached to the
ZIP archive.



The special processing for opening ZIP archives is a trick of the
command\-line shell, not the core SQLite library. So if you want to
open a ZIP archive as a database in your application, you will need to
activate the [Zipfile virtual table](zipfile.html) module then run an appropriate
[CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE](lang_createvtab.html) statement.
