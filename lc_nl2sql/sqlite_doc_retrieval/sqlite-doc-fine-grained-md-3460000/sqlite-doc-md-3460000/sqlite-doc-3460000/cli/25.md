# 13\. Cryptographic Hashes Of Database Content


The ".sha3sum" dot\-command computes a
[SHA3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) hash of the *content*
of the database. To be clear, the hash is computed over the database content,
not its representation on disk. This means, for example, that a [VACUUM](lang_vacuum.html)
or similar data\-preserving transformation does not change the hash.



The ".sha3sum" command supports options "\-\-sha3\-224", "\-\-sha3\-256",
"\-\-sha3\-384", and "\-\-sha3\-512" to define which variety of SHA3 to use
for the hash. The default is SHA3\-256\.



The database schema (in the [sqlite\_schema](schematab.html) table) is not normally
included in the hash, but can be added by the "\-\-schema" option.



The ".sha3sum" command takes a single optional argument which is a
[LIKE](lang_expr.html#like) pattern. If this option is present, only tables whose names match
the [LIKE](lang_expr.html#like) pattern will be hashed.



The ".sha3sum" command is implemented with the help of the
[extension function "sha3\_query()"](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/shathree.c)
that is included with the command\-line shell.
