# 1\.  Overview


SQLite contains built\-in support for profiling SQL queries, but it is not
enabled by default. In order to enable support for query profiling, SQLite must
be compiled with the [following option](compile.html#enable_stmt_scanstatus):




```
-DSQLITE_ENABLE_STMT_SCANSTATUS

```

Building SQLite with this option enables the [sqlite3\_stmt\_scanstatus\_v2()](c3ref/stmt_scanstatus.html)
API, which provides access to the various profiling metrics. The remainder of
this page discusses the profiling reports generated by the SQLite 
[command\-line shell](cli.html) using these metrics, rather than the API directly. 



The profiling reports generated by the shell are very similar to the query
plan reports generated by the [EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN](eqp.html) command. This page assumes 
that the reader is familiar with this format.



Within a command\-line shell compiled with the option above, query profiling
is enabled using the ".scanstats on" command:




```
sqlite> .scanstats on

```

Once enabled, the shell automatically outputs a query profile after each 
SQL query executed. Query profiling can be disabled using ".scanstats off".
For example:




```
sqlite> .scanstats on
sqlite> SELECT a FROM t1, t2 WHERE a IN (1,2,3) AND a=d+e;
QUERY PLAN (cycles=255831538 [100%])
|--SEARCH t1 USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)     (cycles=60048488 [23%] loops=1 rows=3)
`--SCAN t2                                           (cycles=133558052 [52%] loops=3 rows=150000)

```
