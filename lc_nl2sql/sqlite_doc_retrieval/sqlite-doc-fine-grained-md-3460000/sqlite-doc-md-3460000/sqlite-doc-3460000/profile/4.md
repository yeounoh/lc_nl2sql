# 4\. Planner Estimates


As well as ".scanstats on" to enable profiling and ".scanstats off" to
disable it, the shell also accepts ".scanstats est":




```
sqlite> .scanstats est

```

This enables a special kind of profiling report that includes two extra
values associated with each "SCAN..." and "SEARCH..." element of a query
profile:



* **rpl** (rows per loop): This is the value of the "rows" metric
 divided by that of the "loops" metric.
* **est** (estimate): This is the number of rows per loop that the
 query planner estimated would be returned by the current query
 element. If this value is radically different from the actual
 rows per loop value and query performance is unsatisfactory, 
 the quality of this estimate may be improved by running ANALYZE.



```
sqlite> SELECT a FROM t1, t2 WHERE a IN (1,2,3) AND a=d+e ORDER BY a;
<query results...>
QUERY PLAN (cycles=264725190 [100%]
|--SEARCH t1 USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)     (cycles=60511568 [23%] loops=1 rows=3 rpl=3.0 est=3.0)
`--SCAN t2                                           (cycles=139461608 [53%] loops=3 rows=150000 rpl=50000.0 est=1048576.0)

```
