## 2\.4\. The Optional Precision Field


The precision field, if it is present, must follow the width separated
by a single "." character. If there is no width, then the "." that introduces
the precision immediately follows either the flags (if there are any) or
the initial "%".



For string substitutions %s, %z, %q, %Q, or %w the precision is the number
of byte or character used from the argument. The number is bytes by default but
is characters if the "!" flag is present. If there is no precision, then the
entire string is substituted. Examples: "%.3s" substitutes the first 3 bytes
of the argument string. "%!.3s" substitutes the first three characters of the
argument string.



For integer substitutions %d, %i, %x, %X, %o, and %p the precision specifies
minimum number of digits to display. Leading zeros are added if necessary, to
expand the output to the minimum number of digits.



For floating\-point substitutions %e, %E, and %f the precision specifies 
the number of digits to display to the right of the decimal point. With
the %g and %G, the precision is the total number of significant digits, rounded
up to 1 if the specified precision is 0\.



For the character substitution %c a precision N greater than 1 causes the
character to be repeated N times. This is a non\-standard extension found only
in SQLite.



If the precision is a single "\*" character instead of a number, then the
actual precision value is read as an integer from the argument list.
