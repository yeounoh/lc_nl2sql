# 3\. Implementation And History



The core string formatting routine is the sqlite3VXPrintf() function found in the
[printf.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/printf.c) source file. All the
various interfaces invoke (sometimes indirectly) this one core function.
The sqlite3VXPrintf() function began as code written by the first author
of SQLite ([Hipp](crew.html)) when he was a graduate student at Duke University in the
late 1980s. Hipp kept this printf() implementation in his personal toolbox until
he started working on SQLite in 2000\. The code was incorporated into the
SQLite source tree on [2000\-10\-08](https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?c=f9372072a6)
for SQLite version 1\.0\.9\.




The [Fossil Version Control System](https://www.fossil-scm.org/) uses its own
printf() implementation that is derived from an early version of the SQLite
printf() implementation, but those two implementations have since diverged.




The [sqlite3\_snprintf()](c3ref/mprintf.html) function has its buffer pointer and buffer size
arguments reversed from what is found in the standard C library snprintf()
routine. This is because there was no snprintf() routine in the
standard C library
when Hipp was first implementing his version, and he chose a different order
than the designers of the standard C library.
