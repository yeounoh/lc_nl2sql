## 2\.5\. The Options Flags Field


Flags consist of zero or more characters that immediately follow the
"%" that introduces the substitution. The various flags and their meanings
are as follows:






| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **\-** | Left\-justify the value in the output. The default is to right\-justify. If the width is zero or is otherwise less than the length of the value being substituted, then there is no padding and the "\-" flag is a no\-op. |
| **\+** | For signed numeric substitutions, include a "\+" sign before positive numbers. A "\-" sign always appears before negative numbers regardless of flag settings. |
| *(space)* | For signed numeric substitutions, prepend a single space before positive numbers. |
| **0** | (The zero\-padding option) Prepend as many "0" characters to numeric substitutions as necessary to expand the value out to the specified width. If the width field is omitted, then this flag is a no\-op. Infinity and NaN (Not\-A\-Number) floating point values are normally rendered as "Inf" and "NaN", respectively, but with the zero\-padding option enabled they are rendered as "9\.0e\+999" and "null". In other words, with the zero\-padding option, floating\-point Infinity and NaN are rendered as valid SQL and JSON literals. |
| **\#** | This is the "alternate\-form\-1" flag. For %g and %G substitutions, this causes trailing zeros to be removed. This flag forces a decimal point to appear for all floating\-point substitutions. For %o, %x, and %X substitutions, the alternate\-form\-1 flag cause the value to be prepended with "0", "0x", or "0X", respectively. |
| **,** | The comma option causes comma separators to be added to the output of numeric substitutions (%d, %f, and similar) before every 3rd digits to the left of the decimal point. No commas are added for digits to the right of the decimal point. This can help humans to more easily discern the magnitude of large integer values. For example, the value 2147483647 would be rendered as "2147483647" using "%d" but would appear as "2,147,483,647" with "%,d". This flag is a non\-standard extension. |
| **!** | This is the "alternate\-form\-2 flag. For string substitutions, this flag causes the width and precision to be understand in terms of characters rather than bytes. For floating point substitutions, the alternate\-form\-2 flag increases the  maximum number of significant digits displayed from 16 to 26, forces the display of the decimal point and causes at least one digit to appear after the decimal point. The alternate\-form\-2 flag is a non\-standard extension that appears in no other printf() implementations, as far as we know. |
