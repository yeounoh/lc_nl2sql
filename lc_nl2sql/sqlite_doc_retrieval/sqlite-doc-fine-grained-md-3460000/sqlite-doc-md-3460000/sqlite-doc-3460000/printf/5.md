## 2\.1\. Substitution Types


The following chart shows the substitution types supported by SQLite:






| Substitution Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| % | Two "%" characters in a row are translated into a single "%" in the output,  without substituting any values. |
| d, i | The argument is a signed integer which is displayed in decimal. |
| u | The argument is an unsigned integer which is displayed in decimal. |
| f | The argument is a double which is displayed in decimal. |
| e, E | The argument is a double which is displayed in exponential notation.  The exponent character is 'e' or 'E' depending on the type. |
| g, G | The argument is a double which is displayed in either normal decimal  notation or if the exponent is not close to zero, in exponential  notation. |
| x, X | The argument is an integer which is displayed in hexadecimal.  Lower\-case hexadecimal is used for %x and upper\-case is used  for %X |
| o | The argument is an integer which is displayed in octal. |
| s, z | The argument is either a zero\-terminated string that is displayed,  or a null pointer which is treated as an empty string. For  the %z type in C\-language interfaces, [sqlite3\_free()](c3ref/free.html) is invoked  on the string after it has been copied into the output. The %s and %z  substitutions are identical for the SQL printf() function, with  a NULL argument treated as an empty string.  The %s substitution is universal among printf functions, but  the %z substitution and safe treatment of null pointers  are SQLite enhancements, not found in other  printf() implementations. |
| c | For the C\-language interfaces, the argument is an integer which  is interpreted as a character. For the [format() SQL function](lang_corefunc.html#format) the  argument is a string from which the first character is extracted and  displayed. |
| p | The argument is a pointer which is displayed as a hexadecimal address.  Since the SQL language has no concept of a pointer, the %p substitution  for the [format() SQL function](lang_corefunc.html#format) works like %x. |
| n | The argument is a pointer to an integer. Nothing is displayed for  this substitution type. Instead, the integer to which the argument  points is overwritten with the number of characters in the generated  string that result from all format symbols to the left of the %n. |
| q, Q | The argument is a zero\-terminated string. The string is printed with  all single quote (') characters doubled so that the string can safely  appear inside an SQL string literal. The %Q substitution type also  puts single\-quotes on both ends of the substituted string.  If the argument  to %Q is a null pointer then the output is an unquoted "NULL". In other  words, a null pointer generates an SQL NULL, and a non\-null pointer generates  a valid SQL string literal. If the argument to %q is a null pointer  then no output is generated. Thus a null\-pointer to %q is the same as  an empty string.  For these substitutions, the precision is the number of bytes or  characters taken from the argument, not the number of bytes or characters that  are written into the output.    The %q and %Q substitutions are SQLite enhancements, not found in  most other printf() implementations. |
| w | This substitution works like %q except that it doubles all double\-quote  characters (") instead of single\-quotes, making the result suitable for  using with a double\-quoted identifier name in an SQL statement.    The %w substitution is an SQLite enhancements, not found in  most other printf() implementations. |
