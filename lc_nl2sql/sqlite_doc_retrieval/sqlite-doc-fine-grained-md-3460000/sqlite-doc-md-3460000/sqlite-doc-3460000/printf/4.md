# 2\. Formatting Details


The format string for printf() is a template for the generated
string. Substitutions are made whenever a "%" character appears in
the format string. The "%" is followed by one or more additional
characters that describe the substitution. Each substitution has
the following format:




> **%***\[flags]\[width]\[***.***precision]\[length]type*


All substitutions begin with a single "%" and end with a single type character.
The other elements of the substitution are optional.



To include a single "%" character in the output, put two consecutive
"%" characters in the template.
