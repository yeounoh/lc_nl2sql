## 2\.2\. The Optional Length Field


The length of the argument value can be specified by one or more letters
that occur just prior to the substitution type letter. In SQLite, the
length only matter for integer types. The length is ignored for the
[format() SQL function](lang_corefunc.html#format) which always uses 64\-bit values. The following
table shows the length specifiers allowed by SQLite:






| Length Specifier | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *(default)* | An "int" or "unsigned int". 32\-bits on all modern systems. |
| l | A "long int" or "long unsigned int". Also 32\-bits on all modern systems. |
| ll | A "long long int" or "long long unsigned" or an "sqlite3\_int64" or  "sqlite3\_uint64" value. These are 64\-bit integers on all modern systems. |



Only the "ll" length modifier ever makes a difference for SQLite. And
it only makes a difference when using the C\-language interfaces.
