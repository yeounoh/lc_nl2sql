## 2\.3\. The Optional Width Field


The width field specifies the minimum width of the substituted value in
the output. If the string or number that is written into the output is shorter
than the width, then the value is padded. Padding is on the left (the
value is right\-justified) by default. If the "\-" flag is used, then the
padding is on the right and the value is left\-justified.



The width is measured in bytes by default. However, if the "!" flag is
present then the width is in characters. This only makes a difference for
multi\-byte utf\-8 characters, and those only occur on string substitutions.



If the width is a single "\*" character instead of a number, then the
actual width value is read as an integer from the argument list. If the
value read is negative, then the absolute value is used for the width and
the value is left\-justified as if the "\-" flag were present.



If the value being substituted is larger than the width, then full value
is added to the output. In other words, the width is the minimum width of
the value as it is rendered in the output.
