## 7\.1\. Manual Control Of Join Order



 SQLite almost always picks the best join order automatically. It is
 very rare that a developer needs to intervene to give the query planner
 hints about the best join order. The best policy is to make use
 of [PRAGMA optimize](pragma.html#pragma_optimize) to ensure that the query planner has access to
 up\-to\-date statistics on the shape of the data in the database.




 This section describes techniques by which developers can control the
 join order in SQLite, to work around any performance problems that may
 arise. However, the use of these techniques is not recommended, except
 as a last resort.




 If you do encounter a situation where SQLite is picking a suboptimal
 join order even after running [PRAGMA optimize](pragma.html#pragma_optimize), please report your
 situation on the [SQLite Community Forum](https://sqlite.org/forum) so
 that the SQLite maintainers can make new refinements to the query planner
 such that manual intervention is not required.
