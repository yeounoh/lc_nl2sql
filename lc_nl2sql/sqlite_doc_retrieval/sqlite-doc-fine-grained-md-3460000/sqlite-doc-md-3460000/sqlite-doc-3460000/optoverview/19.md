## 10\.1\. Partial ORDER BY via Index



 If a query contains an ORDER BY clause with multiple terms, it might
 be that SQLite can use indexes to cause rows to come out in the order
 of some prefix of the terms in the ORDER BY but that later terms in
 the ORDER BY are not satisfied. In that case, SQLite does block sorting.
 Suppose the ORDER BY clause has four terms and the natural order of the
 query results in rows appearing in order of the first two terms. As
 each row is output by the query engine and enters the sorter, the 
 outputs in the current row corresponding to the first two terms of 
 the ORDER BY are compared against the previous row. If they have
 changed, the current sort is finished and output and a new sort is
 started. This results in a slightly faster sort. Even bigger
 advantages are that many fewer rows need to be held in memory,
 reducing memory requirements, and outputs can begin to appear before
 the core query has run to completion.
