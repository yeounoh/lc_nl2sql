# 18\. The Constant Propagation Optimization



 When a WHERE clause contains two or more equality constraints connected
 by the AND operator such that all of the [affinities](datatype3.html#affinity) of the various
 constraints are the same, then SQLite might use the transitive property
 of equality to construct new "virtual" constraints that can be used to
 simplify expressions and/or improve performance. This is called the
 "constant\-propagation optimization".




 For example, consider the following schema and query:




```
CREATE TABLE t1(a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, b INT, c INT);
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE a=b AND b=5;

```


 SQLite looks at the "a\=b" and "b\=5" constraints and deduces that
 if those two constraints are true, then it must also be the case
 that "a\=5" is true. This means that the desired row can be looked up
 quickly using a value of 5 for the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY.
