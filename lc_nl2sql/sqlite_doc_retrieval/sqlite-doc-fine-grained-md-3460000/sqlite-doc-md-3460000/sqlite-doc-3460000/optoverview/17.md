# 9\. Covering Indexes



 When doing an indexed lookup of a row, the usual procedure is to
 do a binary search on the index to find the index entry, then extract
 the [rowid](lang_createtable.html#rowid) from the index and use that [rowid](lang_createtable.html#rowid) to do a binary search on
 the original table. Thus a typical indexed lookup involves two
 binary searches.
 If, however, all columns that were to be fetched from the table are
 already available in the index itself, SQLite will use the values
 contained in the index and will never look up the original table
 row. This saves one binary search for each row and can make many
 queries run twice as fast.




 When an index contains all of the data needed for a query and when the
 original table never needs to be consulted, we call that index a
 "covering index".
