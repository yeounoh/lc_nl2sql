## 14\.1\. Hash Joins



 An automatic index is almost the same thing as a
 [hash join](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_join). The only difference
 is that a B\-Tree is used instead of a hash table. If you are willing to
 say that the transient B\-Tree constructed for an automatic index is
 really just a fancy hash table, then a query that uses an automatic
 index is just a hash join.




 SQLite constructs a transient index instead of a hash table in this
 instance because it already has a robust and high performance B\-Tree
 implementation at hand, whereas a hash\-table would need to be added.
 Adding a separate hash table implementation to handle this one case
 would increase the size of the library (which is designed for use on
 low\-memory embedded devices) for minimal performance gain. SQLite might
 be enhanced with a hash\-table implementation someday, but for now it seems
 better to continue using automatic indexes in cases where client/server
 database engines might use a hash join.
