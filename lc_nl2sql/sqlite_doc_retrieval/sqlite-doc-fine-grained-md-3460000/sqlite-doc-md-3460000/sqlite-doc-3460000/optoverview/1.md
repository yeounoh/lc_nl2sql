# 1\. Introduction



 This document provides an overview of how the query planner and optimizer
 for SQLite works.





 Given a single SQL statement, there might be dozens, hundreds, or even
 thousands of ways to implement that statement, depending on the complexity
 of the statement itself and of the underlying database schema. The 
 task of the query planner is to select the algorithm that minimizes
 disk I/O and CPU overhead.





 Additional background information is available in the
 [indexing tutorial](queryplanner.html) document.
 The [Next Generation Query Planner](queryplanner-ng.html) document provides more detail on
 how the [join order](optoverview.html#joins) is chosen.
