# 10\. ORDER BY Optimizations



 SQLite attempts to use an index to satisfy the ORDER BY clause of a
 query when possible.
 When faced with the choice of using an index to satisfy WHERE clause
 constraints or satisfying an ORDER BY clause, SQLite does the same
 cost analysis described above
 and chooses the index that it believes will result in the fastest answer.




 SQLite will also attempt to use indexes to help satisfy GROUP BY clauses
 and the DISTINCT keyword. If the nested loops of the join can be arranged
 such that rows that are equivalent for the GROUP BY or for the DISTINCT are
 consecutive, then the GROUP BY or DISTINCT logic can determine if the 
 current row is part of the same group or if the current row is distinct
 simply by comparing the current row to the previous row.
 This can be much faster than the alternative of comparing each row to
 all prior rows.
