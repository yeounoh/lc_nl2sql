## 4\.1\. Converting OR\-connected constraint into an IN operator



 If a term consists of multiple subterms containing a common column
 name and separated by OR, like this:


> ```
> 
>   column = expr1 OR column = expr2 OR column = expr3 OR ...
> 
> ```





 Then that term is rewritten as follows:


> ```
> 
>   column IN (expr1,expr2,expr3,...)
> 
> ```





 The rewritten term then might go on to constrain an index using the
 normal rules for **IN** operators. Note that *column* must be
 the same column in every OR\-connected subterm,
 although the column can occur on either the left or the right side of
 the **\=** operator.
