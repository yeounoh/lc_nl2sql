# 13\. The MIN/MAX Optimization



 Queries that contain a single MIN() or MAX() aggregate function whose
 argument is the left\-most column of an index might be satisfied
 by doing a single index lookup rather than by scanning the entire table.
 Examples:




```
SELECT MIN(x) FROM table;
SELECT MAX(x)+1 FROM table;

```
