# 2\. Details


The designed query interface is:




```
SELECT DISTINCT candidate COLLATE nocase
  FROM completion($prefix, $wholeline)
 ORDER BY 1;

```

The query above will return suggestions for the whole input word that
begins with $prefix. The $wholeline parameter is all text from the beginning
of the line up to the insertion point. The $wholeline parameter is used
for context.



The $prefix parameter may be NULL, in which case the prefix is deduced
from $wholeline. Or, the $wholeline parameter may be NULL or omitted if 
context information is unavailable or if context\-aware completion is not
desired.



The completion table might return the same candidate more than once, and
it will return candidates in an arbitrary order. The DISTINCT keyword and
the ORDER BY in the sample query above are added to make the answers unique
and in lexicographical order.
