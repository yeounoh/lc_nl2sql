# 3\. Limitations


The completion table is designed for interactive use. It will return
answers at a speed appropriate for human typing. No effort is made to
be unusually efficient, so long as the response time is nearly instantaneous
in a user interface.



As of this writing (2017\-07\-13\), the completion virtual table only
looks for SQL keywords, and schema, table, and column names. The
context contained in $wholeline is completely ignored. Future enhancements
will try to return new completions taken from function and pragma names
and other sources, as well as consider more context. The completion
table should be considered a work\-in\-progress.
