## 2\.1\. Example Usage


The completion table is used to implement tab\-completion in the
[command\-line shell](cli.html) in conjunction with either the readline or linenoise
input line editing packages for unix. See the
<https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/shell.c.in> source file for example
code. Search for "FROM completion" to find the relevant code sections.



Because the completion table is built into the command\-line shell in order
to provide for tab\-completions, you can run test queries against the
completion table directly in the command\-line shell. Simply type a
query such as the example shown above, filling in appropriate values
for $prefix and $wholeline, and observe the output.
