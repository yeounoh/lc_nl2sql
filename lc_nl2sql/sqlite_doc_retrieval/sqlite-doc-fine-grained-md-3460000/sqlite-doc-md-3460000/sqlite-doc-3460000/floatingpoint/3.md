## 1\.2\. Floating Point Numbers



The binary64 floating\-point format uses 64 bits per number. Hence there
are 1\.845e\+19 different possible floating point values. On the other hand
there are infinitely many real numbers in the range of 
1\.7977e\+308 and 4\.9407e\-324\. It follows then that binary64 cannot possibly
represent all possible real numbers within that range. Approximations are
required.




An IEEE 754 floating\-point value is an integer multiplied by a power
of two:




> M Ã— 2E


The M value is the "mantissa" and E is the "exponent". Both
M and E are integers.



For Binary64, M is a 53\-bit integer and E is an 11\-bit integer that is
offset so that represents a range of values between \-1074 and \+972, inclusive.



*(NB: The usual description of IEEE 754 is more complex, and it is important
to understand the added complexity if you really want to appreciate the details,
merits, and limitations of IEEE 754\. However, the integer description shown
here, while not exactly right, is easier to understand and is sufficient for
the purposes of this article.)*
