## 1\.1\. Floating\-Point Accuracy



SQLite promises to preserve the 15 most significant digits of a floating
point value. However, it makes no guarantees about the accuracy of
computations on floating point values, as no such guarantees are possible.
Performing math on floating\-point values introduces error.
For example, consider what happens if you attempt to subtract two floating\-point
numbers of similar magnitude:




> | 1152693165\.1106291898 |
> | --- |
> | \-1152693165\.1106280772 |
> | --- |
> | 0\.0000011126 |


The result shown above (0\.0000011126\) is the correct answer. But if you
do this computation using binary64 floating\-point, the answer you get is
0\.00000095367431640625 \- an error of about 14%. If you do many similar
computations as part of your program, the errors add up so that your final
result might be completely meaningless.



The error arises because only about the first 15 significant digits of
each number are stored accurately, and the first difference between the two numbers
being subtracted is in the 16th digit.
