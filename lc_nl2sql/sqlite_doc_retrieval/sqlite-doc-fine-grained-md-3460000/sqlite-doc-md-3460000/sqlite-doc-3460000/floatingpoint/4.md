### 1\.2\.1\. Unrepresentable numbers


Not every decimal number with fewer than 16 significant digits can be
represented exactly as a binary64 number. In fact, most decimal numbers
with digits to the right of the decimal point lack an exact binary64
equivalent. For example, if you have a database column that is intended
to hold an item price in dollars and cents, the only cents value that
can be exactly represented are 0\.00, 0\.25, 0\.50, and 0\.75\. Any other
numbers to the right of the decimal point result in an approximation.
If you provide a "price" value of 47\.49, that number will be represented
in binary64 as:




> 6683623321994527 Ã— 2\-47


Which works out to be:




> 47\.49000000000000198951966012828052043914794921875


That number is very close to 47\.49, but it is not exact. It is a little
too big. If we reduce M by one to 6683623321994526 so that we have the
next smaller possible binary64 value, we get:




> 47\.4899999999999948840923025272786617279052734375



This second number is too small.
The first number is closer to the desired value of 47\.49, so that is the
one that gets used. But it is not exact. Most decimal values work this
way in IEEE 754\. Remember the key point we made above:




> **Floating point values are approximate.**


If you remember nothing else about floating\-point values, 
please don't forget this one key idea.
