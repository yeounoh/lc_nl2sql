## 2\.1\. The ieee754\.c Extension


The ieee754 extension converts a floating point number between its
binary64 representation and the M×2E format.
In other words in the expression:




> F \= M × 2E


The ieee754 extension converts between F and (M,E) and back again.



The ieee754 extension is not part of the [amalgamation](amalgamation.html), but it is included
by default in the [CLI](cli.html). If you want to include the ieee754 extension in your
application, you will need to compile and load it separately.
