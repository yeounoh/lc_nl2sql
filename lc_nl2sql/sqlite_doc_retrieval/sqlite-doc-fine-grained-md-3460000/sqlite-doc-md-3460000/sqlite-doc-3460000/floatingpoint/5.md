### 1\.2\.2\. Is it close enough?


The precision provided by IEEE 754 Binary64 is sufficient for most computations.
For example, if "47\.49" represents a price and inflation is running
at 2% per year, then the price is going up by about 0\.0000000301 dollars per
second. The error in the recorded value of 47\.49 represents about 66 nanoseconds
worth of inflation. So if the 47\.49 price is exact
when you enter it, then the effects of inflation will cause the true value to
exactly equal the value actually stored
(47\.4900000000000019895196601282805204391479492187\) in less than 
one ten\-millionth of a second.
Surely that level of precision is sufficient for most purposes?
