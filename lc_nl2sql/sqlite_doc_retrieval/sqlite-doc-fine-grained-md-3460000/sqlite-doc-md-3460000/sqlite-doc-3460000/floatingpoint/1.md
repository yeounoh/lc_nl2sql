# 1\. How SQLite Stores Numbers



SQLite stores integer values in the 64\-bit 
[twos\-complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement)
format\&sup1\.
This gives a storage range of \-9223372036854775808 to \+9223372036854775807,
inclusive. Integers within this range are exact.





So\-called "REAL" or floating point values are stored in the
[IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754)
[Binary\-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)
format\&sup1\.
This gives a range of positive values between approximately
1\.7976931348623157e\+308 and 4\.9406564584124654e\-324 with an equivalent
range of negative values. A binary64 can also be 0\.0 (and \-0\.0\), positive
and negative infinity and "NaN" or "Not\-a\-Number". Floating point
values are approximate.




Pay close attention to the last sentence in the previous paragraph:



> **Floating point values are approximate.**



If you need an exact answer, you should not use binary64 floating\-point
values, in SQLite or in any other product. This is not an SQLite limitation.
It is a mathematical limitation inherent in the design of floating\-point numbers.

Exception: The [R\-Tree extension](rtree.html) stores information as 32\-bit floating
point or integer values.
