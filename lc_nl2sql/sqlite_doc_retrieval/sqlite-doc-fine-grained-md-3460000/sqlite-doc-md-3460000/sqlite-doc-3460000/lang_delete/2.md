# 2\. Restrictions on DELETE Statements Within CREATE TRIGGER


The following restrictions apply to DELETE statements that occur within the
 body of a [CREATE TRIGGER](lang_createtrigger.html) statement:



* The table\-name specified as part of a 
 DELETE statement within
 a trigger body must be unqualified. In other words, the
 *schema\-name***.** prefix on the table name is not allowed 
 within triggers. If the table to which the trigger is attached is
 not in the temp database, then DELETE statements within the trigger
 body must operate on tables within the same database as it. If the table
 to which the trigger is attached is in the TEMP database, then the
 unqualified name of the table being deleted is resolved in the same way as
 it is for a top\-level statement (by searching first the TEMP database, then
 the main database, then any other databases in the order they were
 attached).
* The INDEXED BY and NOT INDEXED clauses are not allowed on DELETE
 statements within triggers.
* The LIMIT and ORDER BY clauses (described below) are unsupported for
 DELETE statements within triggers.
* The RETURNING clause is not supported for triggers.
