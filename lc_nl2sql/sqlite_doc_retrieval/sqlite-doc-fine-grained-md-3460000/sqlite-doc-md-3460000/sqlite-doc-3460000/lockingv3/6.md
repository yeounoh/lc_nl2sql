### 4\.2 Deleting stale super\-journals


A stale super\-journal is a super\-journal that is no longer being
used for anything. There is no requirement that stale super\-journals
be deleted. The only reason for doing so is to free up disk space.


A super\-journal is stale if no individual file journals are pointing
to it. To figure out if a super\-journal is stale, we first read the
super\-journal to obtain the names of all of its file journals. Then
we check each of those file journals. If any of the file journals named
in the super\-journal exists and points back to the super\-journal, then
the super\-journal is not stale. If all file journals are either missing
or refer to other super\-journals or no super\-journal at all, then the
super\-journal we are testing is stale and can be safely deleted.
