### 5\.1 Writer starvation


In SQLite version 2, if many processes are reading from the database,
it might be the case that there is never a time when there are
no active readers. And if there is always at least one read lock on the
database, no process would ever be able to make changes to the database
because it would be impossible to acquire a write lock. This situation
is called *writer starvation*.


SQLite version 3 seeks to avoid writer starvation through the use of
the PENDING lock. The PENDING lock allows existing readers to continue
but prevents new readers from connecting to the database. So when a
process wants to write a busy database, it can set a PENDING lock which
will prevent new readers from coming in. Assuming existing readers do
eventually complete, all SHARED locks will eventually clear and the
writer will be given a chance to make its changes.
