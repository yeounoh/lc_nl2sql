## 2\.0 Overview



Locking and concurrency control are handled by the 
[pager module](https://www.sqlite.org/src/finfo?name=src/pager.c).
The pager module is responsible for making SQLite "ACID" (Atomic,
Consistent, Isolated, and Durable). The pager module makes sure changes
happen all at once, that either all changes occur or none of them do,
that two or more processes do not try to access the database
in incompatible ways at the same time, and that once changes have been
written they persist until explicitly deleted. The pager also provides
a memory cache of some of the contents of the disk file.


The pager is unconcerned
with the details of B\-Trees, text encodings, indices, and so forth.
From the point of view of the pager the database consists of
a single file of uniform\-sized blocks. Each block is called a
"page" and is usually 1024 bytes in size. The pages are numbered
beginning with 1\. So the first 1024 bytes of the database are called
"page 1" and the second 1024 bytes are call "page 2" and so forth. All 
other encoding details are handled by higher layers of the library. 
The pager communicates with the operating system using one of several
modules 
(Examples:
[os\_unix.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/finfo?name=src/os_unix.c),
[os\_win.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/finfo?name=src/os_win.c))
that provides a uniform abstraction for operating system services.



The pager module effectively controls access for separate threads, or
separate processes, or both. Throughout this document whenever the
word "process" is written you may substitute the word "thread" without
changing the truth of the statement.
