## 1\.0 File Locking And Concurrency In SQLite Version 3


SQLite [Version 3\.0\.0](releaselog/3_0_0.html) introduced a new locking and journaling 
mechanism designed to improve concurrency over SQLite version 2
and to reduce the writer starvation 
problem. The new mechanism also allows atomic commits of transactions
involving multiple database files.
This document describes the new locking mechanism.
The intended audience is programmers who want to understand and/or modify
the pager code and reviewers working to verify the design
of SQLite version 3\.
