## 3\.0 Locking



From the point of view of a single process, a database file
can be in one of five locking states:






| UNLOCKED | No locks are held on the database. The database may be neither read nor written. Any internally cached data is considered suspect and subject to verification against the database file before being used. Other  processes can read or write the database as their own locking states permit. This is the default state. |
| --- | --- |
| SHARED | The database may be read but not written. Any number of  processes can hold SHARED locks at the same time, hence there can be many simultaneous readers. But no other thread or process is allowed to write to the database file while one or more SHARED locks are active. |
| RESERVED | A RESERVED lock means that the process is planning on writing to the database file at some point in the future but that it is currently just reading from the file. Only a single RESERVED lock may be active at one time, though multiple SHARED locks can coexist with a single RESERVED lock. RESERVED differs from PENDING in that new SHARED locks can be acquired while there is a RESERVED lock. |
| PENDING | A PENDING lock means that the process holding the lock wants to write to the database as soon as possible and is just waiting on all current SHARED locks to clear so that it can get an EXCLUSIVE lock. No new  SHARED locks are permitted against the database if a PENDING lock is active, though existing SHARED locks are allowed to continue. |
| EXCLUSIVE | An EXCLUSIVE lock is needed in order to write to the database file. Only one EXCLUSIVE lock is allowed on the file and no other locks of any kind are allowed to coexist with an EXCLUSIVE lock. In order to maximize concurrency, SQLite works to minimize the amount of time that EXCLUSIVE locks are held. |






The operating system interface layer understands and tracks all five
locking states described above. 
The pager module only tracks four of the five locking states.
A PENDING lock is always just a temporary
stepping stone on the path to an EXCLUSIVE lock and so the pager module
does not track PENDING locks.
