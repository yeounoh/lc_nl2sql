This document was originally created in early 2004 when SQLite version 2
was still in widespread use and was written to introduce
the new concepts of SQLite version 3 to readers who were already familiar
with SQLite version 2\. But these days, most readers of this document have
probably never seen SQLite version 2 and are only familiar with SQLite
version 3\. Nevertheless, this document continues to serve as an
authoritative reference to how database file locking works in SQLite 
version 3\.


The document only describes locking for the older rollback\-mode
transaction mechanism. Locking for the newer [write\-ahead log](wal.html) or [WAL mode](wal.html)
is described separately.
