# 5\. Convenience Wrappers Around Core Routines



 The [sqlite3\_exec()](c3ref/exec.html) interface is a convenience wrapper that carries out
 all four of the above steps with a single function call. A callback
 function passed into [sqlite3\_exec()](c3ref/exec.html) is used to process each row of
 the result set. The [sqlite3\_get\_table()](c3ref/free_table.html) is another convenience wrapper
 that does all four of the above steps. The [sqlite3\_get\_table()](c3ref/free_table.html) interface
 differs from [sqlite3\_exec()](c3ref/exec.html) in that it stores the results of queries
 in heap memory rather than invoking a callback.




 It is important to realize that neither [sqlite3\_exec()](c3ref/exec.html) nor
 [sqlite3\_get\_table()](c3ref/free_table.html) do anything that cannot be accomplished using
 the core routines. In fact, these wrappers are implemented purely in
 terms of the core routines.
