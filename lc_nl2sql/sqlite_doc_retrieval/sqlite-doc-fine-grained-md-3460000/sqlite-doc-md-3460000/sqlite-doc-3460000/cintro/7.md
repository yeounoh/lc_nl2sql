# 7\. Configuring SQLite



 The default configuration for SQLite works great for most applications.
 But sometimes developers want to tweak the setup to try to squeeze out
 a little more performance, or take advantage of some obscure feature.



 The [sqlite3\_config()](c3ref/config.html) interface is used to make global, process\-wide
 configuration changes for SQLite. The [sqlite3\_config()](c3ref/config.html) interface must
 be called before any [database connections](c3ref/sqlite3.html) are created. The
 [sqlite3\_config()](c3ref/config.html) interface allows the programmer to do things like:


* Adjust how SQLite does [memory allocation](malloc.html), including setting up
 alternative memory allocators appropriate for safety\-critical
 real\-time embedded systems and application\-defined memory allocators.
* Set up a process\-wide [error log](errlog.html).
* Specify an application\-defined page cache.
* Adjust the use of mutexes so that they are appropriate for various
 [threading models](threadsafe.html), or substitute an
 application\-defined mutex system.



 After process\-wide configuration is complete and [database connections](c3ref/sqlite3.html)
 have been created, individual database connections can be configured using
 calls to [sqlite3\_limit()](c3ref/limit.html) and [sqlite3\_db\_config()](c3ref/db_config.html).
