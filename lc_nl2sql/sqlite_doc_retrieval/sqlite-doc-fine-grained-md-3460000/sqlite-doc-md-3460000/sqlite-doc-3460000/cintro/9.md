# 9\. Other Interfaces



 This article only mentions the most important and most commonly
 used SQLite interfaces.
 The SQLite library includes many other APIs implementing useful
 features that are not described here.
 A [complete list of functions](c3ref/funclist.html) that form the SQLite
 application programming interface is found at the
 [C/C\+\+ Interface Specification](c3ref/intro.html).
 Refer to that document for complete and authoritative information about
 all SQLite interfaces.
