# 2\. Introduction



 SQLite has more than 225 APIs.
 However, most of the APIs are optional and very specialized
 and can be ignored by beginners.
 The core API is small, simple, and easy to learn.
 This article summarizes the core API.




 A separate document, [The SQLite C/C\+\+ Interface](c3ref/intro.html),
 provides detailed
 specifications for all C/C\+\+ APIs for SQLite. Once
 the reader
 understands the basic principles of operation for SQLite,
 [that document](c3ref/intro.html) should be used as a reference
 guide. This article is intended as introduction only and is neither a
 complete nor authoritative reference for the SQLite API.
