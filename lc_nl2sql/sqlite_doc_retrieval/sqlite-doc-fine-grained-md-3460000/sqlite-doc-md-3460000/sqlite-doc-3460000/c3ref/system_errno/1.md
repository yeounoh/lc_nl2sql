## Low\-level system error code




> ```
> 
> int sqlite3_system_errno(sqlite3*);

Attempt to return the underlying operating system error code or error
number that caused the most recent I/O error or failure to open a file.
The return value is OS\-dependent. For example, on unix systems, after
[sqlite3\_open\_v2()](../c3ref/open.html) returns [SQLITE\_CANTOPEN](../rescode.html#cantopen), this interface could be
called to get back the underlying "errno" that caused the problem, such
as ENOSPC, EAUTH, EISDIR, and so forth.
