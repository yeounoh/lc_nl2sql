## Number Of Columns In A Result Set

Return the number of columns in the result set returned by the
[prepared statement](../c3ref/stmt.html). If this routine returns 0, that means the
[prepared statement](../c3ref/stmt.html) returns no data (for example an [UPDATE](../lang_update.html)).
However, just because this routine returns a positive number does not
mean that one or more rows of data will be returned. A SELECT statement
will always have a positive sqlite3\_column\_count() but depending on the
WHERE clause constraints and the table content, it might return no rows.
