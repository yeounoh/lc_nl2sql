## Return The Size Of An Open BLOB

Returns the size in bytes of the BLOB accessible via the
successfully opened [BLOB handle](../c3ref/blob.html) in its only argument. The
incremental blob I/O routines can only read or overwriting existing
blob content; they cannot change the size of a blob.


This routine only works on a [BLOB handle](../c3ref/blob.html) which has been created
by a prior successful call to [sqlite3\_blob\_open()](../c3ref/blob_open.html) and which has not
been closed by [sqlite3\_blob\_close()](../c3ref/blob_close.html). Passing any other pointer in
to this routine results in undefined and probably undesirable behavior.
