The sqlite3\_backup object records state information about an ongoing
online backup operation. The sqlite3\_backup object is created by
a call to [sqlite3\_backup\_init()](../c3ref/backup_finish.html#sqlite3backupinit) and is destroyed by a call to
[sqlite3\_backup\_finish()](../c3ref/backup_finish.html#sqlite3backupfinish).
