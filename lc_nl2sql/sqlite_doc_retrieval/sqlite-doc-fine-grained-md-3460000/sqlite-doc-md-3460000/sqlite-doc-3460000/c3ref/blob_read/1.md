## Read Data From A BLOB Incrementally

> int sqlite3_blob_read(sqlite3_blob *, void *Z, int N, int iOffset);

This function is used to read data from an open [BLOB handle](../c3ref/blob.html) into a
caller\-supplied buffer. N bytes of data are copied into buffer Z
from the open BLOB, starting at offset iOffset.


If offset iOffset is less than N bytes from the end of the BLOB,
[SQLITE\_ERROR](../rescode.html#error) is returned and no data is read. If N or iOffset is
less than zero, [SQLITE\_ERROR](../rescode.html#error) is returned and no data is read.
The size of the blob (and hence the maximum value of N\+iOffset)
can be determined using the [sqlite3\_blob\_bytes()](../c3ref/blob_bytes.html) interface.


An attempt to read from an expired [BLOB handle](../c3ref/blob.html) fails with an
error code of [SQLITE\_ABORT](../rescode.html#abort).


On success, sqlite3\_blob\_read() returns SQLITE\_OK.
Otherwise, an [error code](../rescode.html) or an [extended error code](../rescode.html#extrc) is returned.


This routine only works on a [BLOB handle](../c3ref/blob.html) which has been created
by a prior successful call to [sqlite3\_blob\_open()](../c3ref/blob_open.html) and which has not
been closed by [sqlite3\_blob\_close()](../c3ref/blob_close.html). Passing any other pointer in
to this routine results in undefined and probably undesirable behavior.
