## Virtual Table Cursor Object




> ```
>

>   sqlite3_vtab *pVtab;      /* Virtual table of this cursor */
>   /* Virtual table implementations will typically add additional fields */

Every [virtual table module](../c3ref/module.html) implementation uses a subclass of the
following structure to describe cursors that point into the
[virtual table](../vtab.html) and are used
to loop through the virtual table. Cursors are created using the
[xOpen](../vtab.html#xopen) method of the module and are destroyed
by the [xClose](../vtab.html#xclose) method. Cursors are used
by the [xFilter](../vtab.html#xfilter), [xNext](../vtab.html#xnext), [xEof](../vtab.html#xeof), [xColumn](../vtab.html#xcolumn), and [xRowid](../vtab.html#xrowid) methods
of the module. Each module implementation will define
the content of a cursor structure to suit its own needs.


This superclass exists in order to define fields of the cursor that
are common to all implementations.
