## Testing Interface

The sqlite3\_test\_control() interface is used to read out internal
state of SQLite and to inject faults into SQLite for testing
purposes. The first parameter is an operation code that determines
the number, meaning, and operation of all subsequent parameters.


This interface is not for use by applications. It exists solely
for verifying the correct operation of the SQLite library. Depending
on how the SQLite library is compiled, this interface might not exist.


The details of the operation codes, their meanings, the parameters
they take, and what they do are all subject to change without notice.
Unlike most of the SQLite API, this function is not guaranteed to
operate consistently from one release to the next.
