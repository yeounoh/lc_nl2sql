## Finalize A Dynamic String




> ```

> char *sqlite3_str_finish(sqlite3_str*);

The [sqlite3\_str\_finish(X)](../c3ref/str_finish.html) interface destroys the sqlite3\_str object X
and returns a pointer to a memory buffer obtained from [sqlite3\_malloc64()](../c3ref/free.html)
that contains the constructed string. The calling application should
pass the returned value to [sqlite3\_free()](../c3ref/free.html) to avoid a memory leak.
The [sqlite3\_str\_finish(X)](../c3ref/str_finish.html) interface may return a NULL pointer if any
errors were encountered during construction of the string. The
[sqlite3\_str\_finish(X)](../c3ref/str_finish.html) interface will also return a NULL pointer if the
string in [sqlite3\_str](../c3ref/str.html) object X is zero bytes long.
