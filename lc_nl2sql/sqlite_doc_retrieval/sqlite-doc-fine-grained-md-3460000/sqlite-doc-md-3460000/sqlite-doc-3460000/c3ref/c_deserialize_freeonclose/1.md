## Flags for sqlite3\_deserialize()




> ```
> 
> #define SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE 1 /* Call sqlite3_free() on close */
> #define SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_RESIZEABLE  2 /* Resize using sqlite3_realloc64() */
> #define SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_READONLY    4 /* Database is read-only */

The following are allowed values for 6th argument (the F argument) to
the [sqlite3\_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F)](../c3ref/deserialize.html) interface.


The SQLITE\_DESERIALIZE\_FREEONCLOSE means that the database serialization
in the P argument is held in memory obtained from [sqlite3\_malloc64()](../c3ref/free.html)
and that SQLite should take ownership of this memory and automatically
free it when it has finished using it. Without this flag, the caller
is responsible for freeing any dynamically allocated memory.


The SQLITE\_DESERIALIZE\_RESIZEABLE flag means that SQLite is allowed to
grow the size of the database using calls to [sqlite3\_realloc64()](../c3ref/free.html). This
flag should only be used if SQLITE\_DESERIALIZE\_FREEONCLOSE is also used.
Without this flag, the deserialized database cannot increase in size beyond
the number of bytes specified by the M parameter.


The SQLITE\_DESERIALIZE\_READONLY flag means that the deserialized database
should be treated as read\-only.
