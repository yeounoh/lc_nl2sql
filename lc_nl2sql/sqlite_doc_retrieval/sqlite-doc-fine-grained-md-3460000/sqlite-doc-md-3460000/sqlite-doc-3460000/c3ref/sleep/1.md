## Suspend Execution For A Short Time

The sqlite3\_sleep() function causes the current thread to suspend execution
for at least a number of milliseconds specified in its parameter.


If the operating system does not support sleep requests with
millisecond time resolution, then the time will be rounded up to
the nearest second. The number of milliseconds of sleep actually
requested from the operating system is returned.


SQLite implements this interface by calling the xSleep()
method of the default [sqlite3\_vfs](../c3ref/vfs.html) object. If the xSleep() method
of the default VFS is not implemented correctly, or not implemented at
all, then the behavior of sqlite3\_sleep() may deviate from the description
in the previous paragraphs.


If a negative argument is passed to sqlite3\_sleep() the results vary by
VFS and operating system. Some system treat a negative argument as an
instruction to sleep forever. Others understand it to mean do not sleep
at all. In SQLite version 3\.42\.0 and later, a negative
argument passed into sqlite3\_sleep() is changed to zero before it is relayed
down into the xSleep method of the VFS.
