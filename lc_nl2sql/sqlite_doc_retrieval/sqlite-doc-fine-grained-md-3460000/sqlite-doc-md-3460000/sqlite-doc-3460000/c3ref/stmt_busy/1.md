## Determine If A Prepared Statement Has Been Reset

The sqlite3\_stmt\_busy(S) interface returns true (non\-zero) if the
[prepared statement](../c3ref/stmt.html) S has been stepped at least once using
[sqlite3\_step(S)](../c3ref/step.html) but has neither run to completion (returned
[SQLITE\_DONE](../rescode.html#done) from [sqlite3\_step(S)](../c3ref/step.html)) nor
been reset using [sqlite3\_reset(S)](../c3ref/reset.html). The sqlite3\_stmt\_busy(S)
interface returns false if S is a NULL pointer. If S is not a
NULL pointer and is not a pointer to a valid [prepared statement](../c3ref/stmt.html)
object, then the behavior is undefined and probably undesirable.


This interface can be used in combination [sqlite3\_next\_stmt()](../c3ref/next_stmt.html)
to locate all prepared statements associated with a database
connection that are in need of being reset. This can be used,
for example, in diagnostic routines to search for prepared
statements that are holding a transaction open.
