# C\-language Interface Specification for SQLite


These pages are intended to be precise and detailed specification.
For a tutorial introduction, see instead:
* [SQLite In 5 Minutes Or Less](../quickstart.html) and/or
* the [Introduction To The SQLite C/C\+\+ Interface](../cintro.html).


This same content is also available as a
[single large HTML file](../capi3ref.html).



The SQLite interface elements can be grouped into three categories:


1. [**List Of Objects.**](../c3ref/objlist.html)
 This is a list of all abstract objects and datatypes used by the
 SQLite library. There are couple dozen objects in total, but
 the two most important objects are:
 A database connection object [sqlite3](../c3ref/sqlite3.html), and the
 prepared statement object [sqlite3\_stmt](../c3ref/stmt.html).
2. [**List Of Constants.**](../c3ref/constlist.html)
 This is a list of numeric constants used by SQLite and represented by
 \#defines in the sqlite3\.h header file. These constants
 are things such as numeric [result codes](../rescode.html) from
 various interfaces (ex: [SQLITE\_OK](../rescode.html#ok)) or flags passed
 into functions to control behavior
 (ex: [SQLITE\_OPEN\_READONLY](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html)).
3. [**List Of Functions.**](../c3ref/funclist.html)
 This is a list of all functions and methods operating on the
 [objects](../c3ref/objlist.html) and using and/or
 returning [constants](../c3ref/constlist.html). There
 are many functions, but most applications only use a handful.
