## Deprecated Soft Heap Limit Interface

This is a deprecated version of the [sqlite3\_soft\_heap\_limit64()](../c3ref/hard_heap_limit64.html)
interface. This routine is provided for historical compatibility
only. All new applications should use the
[sqlite3\_soft\_heap\_limit64()](../c3ref/hard_heap_limit64.html) interface rather than this one.
