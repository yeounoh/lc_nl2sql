## Set A Busy Timeout




> ```
> 
> int sqlite3_busy_timeout(sqlite3*, int ms);
>

This routine sets a [busy handler](../c3ref/busy_handler.html) that sleeps
for a specified amount of time when a table is locked. The handler
will sleep multiple times until at least "ms" milliseconds of sleeping
have accumulated. After at least "ms" milliseconds of sleeping,
the handler returns 0 which causes [sqlite3\_step()](../c3ref/step.html) to return
[SQLITE\_BUSY](../rescode.html#busy).


Calling this routine with an argument less than or equal to zero
turns off all busy handlers.


There can only be a single busy handler for a particular
[database connection](../c3ref/sqlite3.html) at any given moment. If another busy handler
was defined (using [sqlite3\_busy\_handler()](../c3ref/busy_handler.html)) prior to calling
this routine, that other busy handler is cleared.
