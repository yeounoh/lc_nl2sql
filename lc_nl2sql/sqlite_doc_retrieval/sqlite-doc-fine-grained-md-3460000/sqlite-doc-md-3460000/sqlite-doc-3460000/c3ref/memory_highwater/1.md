## Memory Allocator Statistics

SQLite provides these two interfaces for reporting on the status
of the [sqlite3\_malloc()](../c3ref/free.html), [sqlite3\_free()](../c3ref/free.html), and [sqlite3\_realloc()](../c3ref/free.html)
routines, which form the built\-in memory allocation subsystem.


The [sqlite3\_memory\_used()](../c3ref/memory_highwater.html) routine returns the number of bytes
of memory currently outstanding (malloced but not freed).
The [sqlite3\_memory\_highwater()](../c3ref/memory_highwater.html) routine returns the maximum
value of [sqlite3\_memory\_used()](../c3ref/memory_highwater.html) since the high\-water mark
was last reset. The values returned by [sqlite3\_memory\_used()](../c3ref/memory_highwater.html) and
[sqlite3\_memory\_highwater()](../c3ref/memory_highwater.html) include any overhead
added by SQLite in its implementation of [sqlite3\_malloc()](../c3ref/free.html),
but not overhead added by the any underlying system library
routines that [sqlite3\_malloc()](../c3ref/free.html) may call.


The memory high\-water mark is reset to the current value of
[sqlite3\_memory\_used()](../c3ref/memory_highwater.html) if and only if the parameter to
[sqlite3\_memory\_highwater()](../c3ref/memory_highwater.html) is true. The value returned
by [sqlite3\_memory\_highwater(1\)](../c3ref/memory_highwater.html) is the high\-water mark
prior to the reset.
