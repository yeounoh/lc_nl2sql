The [sqlite3\_mutex\_alloc()](../c3ref/mutex_alloc.html) interface takes a single argument
which is one of these integer constants.


The set of static mutexes may change from one SQLite release to the
next. Applications that override the built\-in mutex logic must be
prepared to accommodate additional static mutexes.
