## Checkpoint a database

> int sqlite3_wal_checkpoint(sqlite3 *db, const char *zDb);

The sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint(D,X) is equivalent to
[sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint\_v2](../c3ref/wal_checkpoint_v2.html)(D,X,[SQLITE\_CHECKPOINT\_PASSIVE](../c3ref/c_checkpoint_full.html),0,0\).


In brief, sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint(D,X) causes the content in the
[write\-ahead log](../wal.html) for database X on [database connection](../c3ref/sqlite3.html) D to be
transferred into the database file and for the write\-ahead log to
be reset. See the [checkpointing](../wal.html#ckpt) documentation for addition
information.


This interface used to be the only way to cause a checkpoint to
occur. But then the newer and more powerful [sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint\_v2()](../c3ref/wal_checkpoint_v2.html)
interface was added. This interface is retained for backwards
compatibility and as a convenience for applications that need to manually
start a callback but which do not need the full power (and corresponding
complication) of [sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint\_v2()](../c3ref/wal_checkpoint_v2.html).
