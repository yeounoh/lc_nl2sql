## Find The Database Handle Of A Prepared Statement




> ```
> 
> sqlite3 *sqlite3_db_handle(sqlite3_stmt*);
> 
> ```



The sqlite3\_db\_handle interface returns the [database connection](../c3ref/sqlite3.html) handle
to which a [prepared statement](../c3ref/stmt.html) belongs. The [database connection](../c3ref/sqlite3.html)
returned by sqlite3\_db\_handle is the same [database connection](../c3ref/sqlite3.html)
that was the first argument
to the [sqlite3\_prepare\_v2()](../c3ref/prepare.html) call (or its variants) that was used to
create the statement in the first place.
