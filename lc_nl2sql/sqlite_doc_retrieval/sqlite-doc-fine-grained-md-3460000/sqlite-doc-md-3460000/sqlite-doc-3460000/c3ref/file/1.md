## OS Interface Open File Handle




> ```

An [sqlite3\_file](../c3ref/file.html) object represents an open file in the
[OS interface layer](../c3ref/vfs.html). Individual OS interface
implementations will
want to subclass this object by appending additional fields
for their own use. The pMethods entry is a pointer to an
[sqlite3\_io\_methods](../c3ref/io_methods.html) object that defines methods for performing
I/O operations on the open file.

 [Functions](../c3ref/funclist.html).
