## Mutex Handle

The mutex module within SQLite defines [sqlite3\_mutex](../c3ref/mutex.html) to be an
abstract type for a mutex object. The SQLite core never looks
at the internal representation of an [sqlite3\_mutex](../c3ref/mutex.html). It only
deals with pointers to the [sqlite3\_mutex](../c3ref/mutex.html) object.


Mutexes are created using [sqlite3\_mutex\_alloc()](../c3ref/mutex_alloc.html).
