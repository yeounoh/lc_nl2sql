Every value in SQLite has one of five fundamental datatypes:


* 64\-bit signed integer
* 64\-bit IEEE floating point number
* string
* BLOB
* NULL



These constants are codes for each of those types.


Note that the SQLITE\_TEXT constant was also used in SQLite version 2
for a completely different meaning. Software that links against both
SQLite version 2 and SQLite version 3 should use SQLITE3\_TEXT, not
SQLITE\_TEXT.
