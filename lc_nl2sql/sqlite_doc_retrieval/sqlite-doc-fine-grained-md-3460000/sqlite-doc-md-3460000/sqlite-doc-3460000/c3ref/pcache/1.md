## Custom Page Cache Object

The sqlite3\_pcache type is opaque. It is implemented by
the pluggable module. The SQLite core has no knowledge of
its size or internal structure and never deals with the
sqlite3\_pcache object except by holding and passing pointers
to the object.


See [sqlite3\_pcache\_methods2](../c3ref/pcache_methods2.html) for additional information.
