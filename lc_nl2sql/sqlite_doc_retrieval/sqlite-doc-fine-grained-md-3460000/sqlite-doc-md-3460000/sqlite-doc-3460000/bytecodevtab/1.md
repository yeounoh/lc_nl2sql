# 1\. Overview



Bytecode and tables\_used are [virtual tables](vtab.html) built into SQLite that
access information about [prepared statements](c3ref/stmt.html).
Both bytecode and tables\_used operate as [table\-valued functions](vtab.html#tabfunc2).
They take a single required argument which is either the text of
an SQL statement, or a pointer to an existing prepared statement.
The bytecode function returns one row of result for each [bytecode](opcode.html)
operation in the prepared statement. The tables\_used function returns
one row for each persistent btree (either a table or an index) accessed
by the prepared statement.
