# 2\. Usage



The bytecode and tables\_used tables are only available if SQLite has
been compiled with the [\-DSQLITE\_ENABLE\_BYTECODE\_VTAB](compile.html#enable_bytecode_vtab) compile\-time option.
The [CLI](cli.html) has been compiled that way, and so you can use the standard
[CLI](cli.html) as a test platform to experiement.




Both virtual tables are read\-only [eponymous\-only virtual tables](vtab.html#epoonlyvtab). You use them
by mentioning them directly in the FROM clause of a SELECT statement.
They both require a single argument which is the SQL statement to be
analyzed. For example:




```
SELECT * FROM bytecode('SELECT * FROM bytecode(?1)');

```


The argument can be either the text of an SQL statement, in which case
the bytecode (or tables\_used) for that statement is returned, or the
argument can be a parameter such as ?1 or $stmt that is later bound
to a [prepared statement](c3ref/stmt.html) object using the
[sqlite3\_bind\_pointer()](c3ref/bind_blob.html) interface. Use a pointer type of
"stmt\-pointer" for the [sqlite3\_bind\_pointer()](c3ref/bind_blob.html) interface.
