# 2\. Compile\-time selection of threading mode



Use the [SQLITE\_THREADSAFE](compile.html#threadsafe) compile\-time parameter to select the
threading mode. If no [SQLITE\_THREADSAFE](compile.html#threadsafe) compile\-time parameter is
present, then serialized mode is used.
This can be made explicit with 
[\-DSQLITE\_THREADSAFE\=1](compile.html#threadsafe).
With
[\-DSQLITE\_THREADSAFE\=0](compile.html#threadsafe) the threading mode is
single\-thread. With
[\-DSQLITE\_THREADSAFE\=2](compile.html#threadsafe) the threading mode is
multi\-thread.




The return value of the [sqlite3\_threadsafe()](c3ref/threadsafe.html) interface is the value
of SQLITE\_THREADSAFE set at compile\-time. It does not reflect changes
to the threading mode made at runtime via the [sqlite3\_config()](c3ref/config.html)
interface or by flags given as the third argument to [sqlite3\_open\_v2()](c3ref/open.html).




If single\-thread mode is selected at compile\-time, then critical
mutexing logic is omitted from the build and it is impossible to
enable either multi\-thread or serialized modes at start\-time or
run\-time.
