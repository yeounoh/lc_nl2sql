# 1\. Overview


SQLite supports three different threading modes:


1. **Single\-thread**.
In this mode, all mutexes are disabled and SQLite is unsafe to use in
more than a single thread at once.
2. **Multi\-thread**.
In this mode, SQLite can be safely used by multiple threads provided that
no single [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html) nor any object derived from database connection,
such as a [prepared statement](c3ref/stmt.html),
is used in two or more threads at the same time.
3. **Serialized**.
In serialized mode, API calls to affect or use any SQLite [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html)
or any object derived from such a database connection
can be made safely from multiple threads.
The effect on an individual object is the same as if the API calls had all
been made in the same order from a single thread. The name "serialized"
arises from the fact that SQLite uses mutexes to serialize access to each
object.



The threading mode can be selected at compile\-time (when the SQLite
library is being compiled from source code) or at start\-time (when the
application that intends to use SQLite is initializing) or at
run\-time (when a new SQLite database connection is being created).
Generally speaking, run\-time overrides start\-time and start\-time
overrides compile\-time. Except, single\-thread mode cannot be
overridden once selected.




The default mode is serialized.
