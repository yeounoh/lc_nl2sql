# 4\. Run\-time selection of threading mode


If single\-thread mode has not been selected at compile\-time or start\-time,
then individual database connections can be created as either multi\-thread
or serialized. It is not possible to downgrade an individual database
connection to single\-thread mode. Nor is it possible to escalate an
individual database connection if the compile\-time or start\-time mode
is single\-thread.


The threading mode for an individual database connection is determined
by flags given as the third argument to [sqlite3\_open\_v2()](c3ref/open.html). The
[SQLITE\_OPEN\_NOMUTEX](c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html) flag causes the database connection to be in the
multi\-thread mode and the [SQLITE\_OPEN\_FULLMUTEX](c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html) flag causes the connection
to be in serialized mode. If neither flag is specified or if
[sqlite3\_open()](c3ref/open.html) or [sqlite3\_open16()](c3ref/open.html) are used instead of 
[sqlite3\_open\_v2()](c3ref/open.html), then the default
mode determined by the compile\-time and start\-time settings is used.
