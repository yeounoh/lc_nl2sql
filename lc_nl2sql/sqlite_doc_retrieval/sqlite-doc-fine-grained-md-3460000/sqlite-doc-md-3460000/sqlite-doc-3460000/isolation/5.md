## Summary


1. Transactions in SQLite are SERIALIZABLE.


- Changes made in one database connection are invisible to all other database
connections prior to commit.


- A query sees all changes that are completed on the same database connection
prior to the start of the query, regardless of whether or not those changes
have been committed.


- If changes occur on the same database connection after a query 
starts running but before the query completes, then it is undefined whether 
or not the query will see those changes.


- If changes occur on the same database connection after a query 
starts running but before the query completes, then the query might return
a changed row more than once, or it might return a row that was previously
deleted.


- For the purposes of the previous four items, two database connections that 
use the same [shared cache](sharedcache.html) and which enable [PRAGMA read\_uncommitted](pragma.html#pragma_read_uncommitted) are
considered to be the same database connection, not separate database
connections.
