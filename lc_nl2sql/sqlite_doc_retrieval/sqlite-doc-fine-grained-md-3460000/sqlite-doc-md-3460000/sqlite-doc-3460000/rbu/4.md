## 2\.2\. Preparing an RBU Update File


All changes to be applied by RBU are stored in a separate SQLite database
called the "RBU database". The database that is to be modified is called
the "target database".



For each table in the target database that will be modified by the update,
a corresponding table is created within the RBU database. The RBU database
table schema is not the same as that of the target database, but is derived
from it as [described below](rbu.html#database_tables).



The RBU database table contains a single row for each target database 
row inserted, updated or deleted by the update. Populating the RBU database
tables is described in [the following section](rbu.html#database_contents).
