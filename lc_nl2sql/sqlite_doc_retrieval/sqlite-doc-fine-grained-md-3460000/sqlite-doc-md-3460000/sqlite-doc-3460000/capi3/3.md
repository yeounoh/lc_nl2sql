### 2\.0 C/C\+\+ Interface



The API for SQLite 3\.0 includes 83 separate functions in addition
to several data structures and \#defines. (A complete
[API reference](c3ref/intro.html) is provided as a separate 
document.)
Fortunately, the interface is not nearly as complex as its size implies.
Simple programs can still make do with only 3 functions:
[sqlite3\_open()](c3ref/open.html), [sqlite3\_exec()](c3ref/exec.html), and [sqlite3\_close()](c3ref/close.html).
More control over the execution of the database engine is provided
using [sqlite3\_prepare\_v2()](c3ref/prepare.html)
to compile an SQLite statement into byte code and
[sqlite3\_step()](c3ref/step.html) to execute that bytecode.
A family of routines with names beginning with 
[sqlite3\_column\_](c3ref/column_blob.html)
is used to extract information about the result set of a query.
Many interface functions come in pairs, with both a UTF\-8 and
UTF\-16 version. And there is a collection of routines
used to implement user\-defined SQL functions and user\-defined
text collating sequences.
