### 1\.0 Overview



SQLite version 3\.0 is a new version of SQLite, derived from
the SQLite 2\.8\.13 code base, but with an incompatible file format
and API.
SQLite version 3\.0 was created to answer demand for the following features:



* Support for UTF\-16\.
* User\-definable text collating sequences.
* The ability to store BLOBs in indexed columns.



It was necessary to move to version 3\.0 to implement these features because
each requires incompatible changes to the database file format. Other
incompatible changes, such as a cleanup of the API, were introduced at the
same time under the theory that it is best to get your incompatible changes
out of the way all at once. 




The API for version 3\.0 is similar to the version 2\.X API,
but with some important changes. Most noticeably, the "sqlite\_"
prefix that occurs on the beginning of all API functions and data
structures are changed to "sqlite3\_". 
This avoids confusion between the two APIs and allows linking against both
SQLite 2\.X and SQLite 3\.0 at the same time.




There is no agreement on what the C datatype for a UTF\-16
string should be. Therefore, SQLite uses a generic type of void\*
to refer to UTF\-16 strings. Client software can cast the void\* 
to whatever datatype is appropriate for their system.
