# 1\. Introduction


SQLite strives to be flexible regarding the datatype of
the content that it stores. For example, if a table column has a type of
"INTEGER", then SQLite tries to convert anything inserted into that column
into an integer. So an attempt to insert the string '123' results
in an integer 123 being inserted. But if the content cannot be losslessly
converted into an integer, for example if the input is 'xyz', then
the original string is inserted instead.
See the [Datatypes In SQLite](datatype3.html) document for additional information.



Some developers [appreciate the freedom](flextypegood.html) that SQLite's flexible typing
rules provide and use that freedom to advantage.
But other developers are aghast at SQLite's
flagrant rule\-breaking and prefer the traditional rigid type
system found in all other SQL database engines and in the
SQL standard. For this latter group, SQLite supports a strict typing
mode, as of version 3\.37\.0 (2021\-11\-27\), that is enabled
separately for each table.
