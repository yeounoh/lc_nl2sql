# 5\. Other Table Options


The SQLite parser accepts a comma\-separated list of table options after
the final close parenthesis in a CREATE TABLE statement. As of this
writing (2021\-08\-23\) only two options are recognized:



* STRICT
* [WITHOUT ROWID](withoutrowid.html)


If there are multiple options, they can be specified in any order.
To keep things simple, the current parser accepts duplicate options without
complaining, but that might change in future releases, so applications
should not rely on it.
