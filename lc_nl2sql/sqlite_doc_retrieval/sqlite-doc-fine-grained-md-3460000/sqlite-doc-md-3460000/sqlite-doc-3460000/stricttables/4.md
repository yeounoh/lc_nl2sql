# 4\. Backwards Compatibility


The STRICT keyword at the end of a CREATE TABLE statement is only
recognized by SQLite version 3\.37\.0 (2021\-11\-27\) and later. If
you try to open a database containing the STRICT keyword in an earlier
version of SQLite, it will not recognize the keyword and will report
an error (except as noted below). But apart from the extra STRICT keyword,
the underlying [file format](fileformat2.html) of the database is identical.



Thus, in general, a database file that contains one or more STRICT
tables can only be read and written by SQLite version 3\.37\.0 or later.
However, a database created by SQLite 3\.37\.0 or later can still be
read and written by earlier versions of SQLite, going all the way back
to version 3\.0\.0 (2004\-06\-18\) as long as the database does not contain
any STRICT tables or other features that were introduced after the older
version of SQLite.



The STRICT keyword may still be used as an identifier.
(It is only treated as a keyword in a certain part of the syntax,
and sqlite3\_keyword\_check(..) does not recognize it as a regular keyword.)
