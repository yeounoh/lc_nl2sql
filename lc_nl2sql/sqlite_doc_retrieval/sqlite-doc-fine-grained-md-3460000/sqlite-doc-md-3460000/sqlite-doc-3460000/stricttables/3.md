# 3\. The ANY datatype


The ability to host any type of data in a single column has proven to
be remarkably useful over the years. In order to continue supporting this
ability, even in STRICT tables, the new ANY datatype name is introduced.
When the datatype of a column is "ANY", that means that any kind of data \- 
integers, floating point values, strings, or binary blobs, can be inserted
into that table and its value and datatype will be preserved exactly as
it is inserted. As far as we know, SQLite is the only SQL database engine
that supports this advanced capability.



The behavior of ANY is slightly different in a
STRICT table versus an ordinary non\-strict table. In a STRICT table,
a column of type ANY always preserves the data exactly as it is received.
For an ordinary non\-strict table, a column of type ANY will attempt to
convert strings that look like numbers into a numeric value, and if
successful will store the numeric value rather than the original string.
For example:






| STRICT | ordinary non\-strict |
| --- | --- |
| ``` CREATE TABLE t1(a ANY) STRICT; INSERT INTO t1 VALUES('000123'); SELECT typeof(a), quote(a) FROM t1; -- result: text '000123' ``` | ```  CREATE TABLE t1(a ANY); INSERT INTO t1 VALUES('000123'); SELECT typeof(a), quote(a) FROM t1; -- result: integer 123 ``` |
