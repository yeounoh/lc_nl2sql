## 9\.2\. Flexible join syntax


Standard SQL has tighter restrictions on join syntax than does SQLite.
In standard SQL, all joins other than comma\-joins, CROSS JOINs, and NATURAL
joins must have either an ON clause or a USING clause and comma\-joins, CROSS JOINs,
and NATURAL joins must not have either an ON or USING clause. SQLite is not
nearly so fussy about join syntax. SQLite will accept and process an ON or USING clause
on a comma\-join or CROSS JOIN, and will let you omit the ON or USING
clause from any join at all. In SQLite, the only restrictions are:



* You cannot have an ON or USING clause on a NATURAL join.
* You cannot have both an ON clause and a USING clause on the same join.



SQLite even allows you to omit the ON or USING clause from an outer join,
though doing so means that the outer join is unconstrained (as if the ON clause
where "ON true") which make the outer join behave like an inner join.
