## 2\.2\. Special handling of CROSS JOIN.


There is no difference between the "INNER JOIN", "JOIN" and "," join
operators. They are completely interchangeable in SQLite.
The "CROSS JOIN" join operator produces the same result as the 
"INNER JOIN", "JOIN" and "," operators, but is 
[handled differently by the query optimizer](optoverview.html#crossjoin)
in that it prevents the query optimizer from reordering
the tables in the join. An application programmer can use the CROSS JOIN 
operator to directly influence the algorithm that is chosen to implement
the SELECT statement. Avoid using CROSS JOIN except in specific situations 
where manual control of the query optimizer is desired. Avoid using
CROSS JOIN early in the development of an application as doing so is
a [premature
optimization](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization). The special handling of CROSS JOIN is an SQLite\-specific
feature and is not a part of standard SQL.
