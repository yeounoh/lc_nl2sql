## 2\.3\. WHERE clause filtering.


If a WHERE clause is specified, the WHERE expression is evaluated for 
each row in the input data as a [boolean expression](lang_expr.html#booleanexpr). Only rows for which the
WHERE clause expression evaluates to true are included from the dataset before
continuing. Rows are excluded from the result if the WHERE clause
evaluates to either false or NULL.



For a JOIN or INNER JOIN or CROSS JOIN, there is no difference between 
a constraint expression in the WHERE clause and one in the ON clause. However,
for a LEFT or RIGHT or FULL OUTER JOIN, the difference is very important. 
In an outer join, the extra NULL rows for non\-matched rows on the other
operand are added after ON clause processing
but before WHERE clause processing. A constraint of the form "left.x\=right.y"
in an ON clause will therefore allow through for the added all\-NULL rows.
But if that same constraint is in the WHERE clause, a NULL in one of
"right.y" or "left.x" will prevent the expression "left.x\=right.y" from being true,
and thus exclude that row from the output.
