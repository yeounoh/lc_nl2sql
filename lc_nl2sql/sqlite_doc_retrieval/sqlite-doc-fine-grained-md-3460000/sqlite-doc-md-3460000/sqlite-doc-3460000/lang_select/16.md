## 9\.1\. Strange JOIN names


SQLite accepts all of the usual syntax for JOIN operators:

**[join\-operator:](syntax/join-operator.html)**
hide








NATURAL





LEFT



OUTER





JOIN




,












RIGHT





FULL




INNER






CROSS








But it does not stop there. SQLite is actually very flexible in how you
specify a join operator. The general syntax is:




> *blah blah blah* **JOIN**


Where there are between 1 and 3 instances of "*blah*", each of which can be
any of "CROSS", "FULL", "INNER", "LEFT", "NATURAL", "OUTER", or "RIGHT". The SQLite
parser treats each of these keywords as an attribute of the join, which can be combined
in any order. This creates the possibility of many new and creative join types beyond
what is specified by the syntax diagram. Some of these non\-standard join types are
specifically disallowed. For example, you cannot say "INNER OUTER JOIN", because
that would be contradictory. But you can say things like "OUTER LEFT NATURAL JOIN"
which means the same as "NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN". Or you can say "LEFT RIGHT JOIN"
which is the same as "FULL JOIN".



Remember: you *can* use these non\-standard join types but you *ought not*.
Stick to using standard JOIN syntax for portability with other SQL database engines.
