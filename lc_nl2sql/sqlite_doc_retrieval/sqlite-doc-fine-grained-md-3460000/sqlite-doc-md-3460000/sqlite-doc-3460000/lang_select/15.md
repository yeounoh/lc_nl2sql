# 9\. Deviations From Standard SQL


The SELECT syntax of SQLite differs slightly from standard SQL.
These differences are due to several reasons:



* In the mid\-2000s, there was a lot of emphasis on keeping the library
 footprint as small as possible, so as not to use too much space
 on memory\-limited flip\-phones and similar.
* During the early years of SQLite, the lead developer sought to follow
 [Postel's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) and to
 be forgiving and flexible in what input was accepted.
* There were bugs in early SQLite parsers that accepts some strange inputs.
* The lead developer's knowledge of SQL was imperfect.


Whatever the origin of the input quirks, we generally avoid trying to "fix" them,
as any new restrictions on the input syntax would likely cause at least some of
the millions of applications that use SQLite to break. We do not want that.
The goal of the SQLite development team is to preserve backwards compability to
the fullest extent possible. Hence, if a syntax quirk is harmless,
we leave it alone and document it here, rather than try to fix it.
