## 2\.1\. Row Value Comparisons


Two row values are compared by looking at the constituent scalar
values from left to right.
A NULL means of "unknown". 
The overall result of comparison is NULL if it is possible to make the
result either true or false by substituting alternative values in place
of the constituent NULLs.
The following query demonstrates some row value comparisons:




```
SELECT
  (1,2,3) = (1,2,3),          -- 1
  (1,2,3) = (1,NULL,3),       -- NULL
  (1,2,3) = (1,NULL,4),       -- 0
  (1,2,3) < (2,3,4),          -- 1
  (1,2,3) < (1,2,4),          -- 1
  (1,2,3) < (1,3,NULL),       -- 1
  (1,2,3) < (1,2,NULL),       -- NULL
  (1,3,5) < (1,2,NULL),       -- 0
  (1,2,NULL) IS (1,2,NULL);   -- 1

```

The result of "(1,2,3\)\=(1,NULL,3\)" is NULL because the result might be
true if we replaced NULL→2 or false if we replaced NULL→9\.
The result of "(1,2,3\)\=(1,NULL,4\)" is not NULL because there is no
substitutions of the constituent NULL that will make the expression true,
since 3 will never equal 4 in the third column.



Any of the row values in the previous example could be replace by a
subquery that returns three columns and the same answer would result.
For example:




```
CREATE TABLE t1(a,b,c);
INSERT INTO t1(a,b,c) VALUES(1,2,3);
SELECT (1,2,3)=(SELECT * FROM t1); -- 1

```
