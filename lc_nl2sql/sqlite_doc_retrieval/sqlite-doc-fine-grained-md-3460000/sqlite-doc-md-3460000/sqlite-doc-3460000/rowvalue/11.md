## 3\.5\. Clarity of presentation


Sometimes the use of row values just makes the SQL easier to read
and write. Consider the following two UPDATE statements:




```
UPDATE tab1 SET (a,b)=(b,a);
UPDATE tab1 SET a=b, b=a;

```

Both UPDATE statements do exactly the same thing. (They generate
identical [bytecode](opcode.html).) But the first form, the row value form, seems
to make it clearer that the intent of the statement is to swap the
values in columns A and B.



Or consider these identical queries:




```
SELECT * FROM tab1 WHERE a=?1 AND b=?2;
SELECT * FROM tab1 WHERE (a,b)=(?1,?2);

```

Once again, the SQL statements generate identical bytecode and thus
do exactly the same job in exactly the same way. But the second form
is made easier for humans to read by grouping the query parameters together
into a single row value rather than scattering them across the WHERE
clause.
