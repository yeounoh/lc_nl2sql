# 2\. Syntax


SQLite allows row values to be expressed in two ways:


1. A parenthesized, comma\-separated list of scalar values.
2. A subquery expression with two or more result columns.


SQLite can use row values in two contexts:


1. Two row values of the same size 
can be compared using operators \<, \<\=, \>, \>\=,
\=, \<\>, IS, IS NOT, IN, NOT IN, BETWEEN, or CASE.
2. In an [UPDATE](lang_update.html) statement, a list of column names can be set to a row value of
the same size.


The syntax for row values and the circumstances in which row values
can be used are illustrated in examples below.
