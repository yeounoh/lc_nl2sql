## 3\.2\. Comparison of dates stored as separate fields


The usual way of storing a date in a database table is as a single
field, as either a unix timestamp, a julian day number, or an ISO\-8601
dates string. But some application store dates as three separate
fields for the year, month, and day. 




```
CREATE TABLE info(
  year INT,          -- 4 digit year
  month INT,         -- 1 through 12
  day INT,           -- 1 through 31
  other_stuff BLOB   -- blah blah blah
);

```

When dates are stored this way, row value comparisons provide a
convenient way to compare dates:




```
SELECT * FROM info
 WHERE (year,month,day) BETWEEN (2015,9,12) AND (2016,9,12);

```
