## 3\.2\. Destructor Functions



The last parameter to the [sqlite3\_bind\_pointer()](c3ref/bind_blob.html) and
[sqlite3\_result\_pointer()](c3ref/result_blob.html) routines is a pointer to a procedure
used to dispose of the P pointer once SQLite has finished with it.
This pointer can be NULL, in which case no destructor is called.




When the D parameter is not NULL, that means that ownership of the
pointer is being transferred to SQLite. SQLite will take responsibility
for freeing resources associated with the pointer when it has finished
using the pointer. If the D parameter is NULL, that means that ownership
of the pointer remains with the caller and the caller is responsible for
disposing of the pointer.




Note that the destructor function D is for the pointer value P, not for
the type string T. The type string T should be a static string with an
infinite lifetime.




If ownership of the pointer is passed into SQLite by providing a
non\-NULL D parameter to [sqlite3\_bind\_pointer()](c3ref/bind_blob.html) or [sqlite3\_result\_pointer()](c3ref/result_blob.html)
then the ownership remains with SQLite until the object is destroyed.
There is no way to transfer ownership out of SQLite and back into the
application again.
