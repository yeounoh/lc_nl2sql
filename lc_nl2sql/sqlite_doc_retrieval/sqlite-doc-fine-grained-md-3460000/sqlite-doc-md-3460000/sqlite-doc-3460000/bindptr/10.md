# 4\. Restrictions On The Use of Pointer Values



The pointers that piggy\-back on SQL NULL values using the
[sqlite3\_bind\_pointer()](c3ref/bind_blob.html), [sqlite3\_result\_pointer()](c3ref/result_blob.html), and
[sqlite3\_value\_pointer()](c3ref/value_blob.html) interface are transient and ephemeral.
The pointers are never written into the database. The pointers
will not survive sorting. The latter fact is why there is no
sqlite3\_column\_pointer() interface, since it is impossible to
predict whether or not the query planner will insert a sort operation
prior to returning a value from a query, so it would be impossible to
know if a pointer value inserted into a query by
[sqlite3\_bind\_pointer()](c3ref/bind_blob.html) or [sqlite3\_result\_pointer()](c3ref/result_blob.html) would survive
through to the result set.




Pointer values must flow directly from their producer into their
consumer, with no intermediate operators or functions. Any transformation
of a pointer value destroys the pointer and transforms the value into
an ordinary SQL NULL.
