# 1\. Overview



Three new "\_pointer()" interfaces were added to SQLite 3\.20\.0 (2017\-08\-01\):


* [sqlite3\_bind\_pointer()](c3ref/bind_blob.html),
* [sqlite3\_result\_pointer()](c3ref/result_blob.html), and
* [sqlite3\_value\_pointer()](c3ref/value_blob.html).


Questions and confusion quickly arose
on the [mailing lists](support.html#mailinglists) about the purpose behind these new interfaces,
why they were introduced, and what problem they solve. This essay attempts
to answer those questions and clear up the confusion.
