## Conclusion



SQLite is not the perfect application file format for every situation.
But in many cases, SQLite is a far better choice than either a custom
file format, a pile\-of\-files, or a wrapped pile\-of\-files.
SQLite is a high\-level, stable, reliable, cross\-platform, widely\-deployed,
extensible, performant, accessible, concurrent file format. It deserves
your consideration as the standard file format on your next application
design.
