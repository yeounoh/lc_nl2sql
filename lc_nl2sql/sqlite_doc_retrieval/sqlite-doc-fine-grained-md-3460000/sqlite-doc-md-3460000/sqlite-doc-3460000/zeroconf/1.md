## SQLite Is A Zero\-Configuration Database



SQLite does not need to be "installed" before it is used. 
There is no "setup" procedure. There is no
server process that needs to be started, stopped, or configured.
There is
no need for an administrator to create a new database instance or assign
access permissions to users.
SQLite uses no configuration files.
Nothing needs to be done to tell the system that SQLite is running.
No actions are required to recover after a system crash or power failure.
There is nothing to troubleshoot.




SQLite just works.




Other database engines may run great once you get them going.
But doing the initial installation and configuration can often
be intimidating.
