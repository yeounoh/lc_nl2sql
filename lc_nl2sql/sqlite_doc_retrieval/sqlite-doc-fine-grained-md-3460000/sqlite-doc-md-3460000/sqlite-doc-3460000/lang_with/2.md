# 2\. Ordinary Common Table Expressions


An ordinary common table expression works as if it were a [view](lang_createview.html) that
exists for the duration of a single statement. Ordinary common table
expressions are useful for factoring out subqueries and making the overall
SQL statement easier to read and understand.



A WITH clause can contain ordinary common table expressions even if
it includes the RECURSIVE keyword. The use of RECURSIVE does not force
common table expressions to be recursive.
