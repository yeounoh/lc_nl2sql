## 3\.4\. Controlling Depth\-First Versus Breadth\-First Search Of a Tree
Using ORDER BY


An ORDER BY clause on the recursive\-select can be used to control
whether the search of a tree is depth\-first or breadth\-first. To
illustrate, we will use a variation on the "org" table from an example
above, without the "height" column, and with some real data inserted:




> ```
> 
> CREATE TABLE org(
>   name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
>   boss TEXT REFERENCES org
> ) WITHOUT ROWID;
> INSERT INTO org VALUES('Alice',NULL);
> INSERT INTO org VALUES('Bob','Alice');
> INSERT INTO org VALUES('Cindy','Alice');
> INSERT INTO org VALUES('Dave','Bob');
> INSERT INTO org VALUES('Emma','Bob');
> INSERT INTO org VALUES('Fred','Cindy');
> INSERT INTO org VALUES('Gail','Cindy');
> 
> ```


Here is a query to show the tree structure in a breadth\-first pattern:




> ```
> 
> WITH RECURSIVE
>   under_alice(name,level) AS (
>     VALUES('Alice',0)
>     UNION ALL
>     SELECT org.name, under_alice.level+1
>       FROM org JOIN under_alice ON org.boss=under_alice.name
>      ORDER BY 2
>   )
> SELECT substr('..........',1,level*3) || name FROM under_alice;
> 
> ```


The "ORDER BY 2" (which means the same as "ORDER BY under\_alice.level\+1")
causes higher levels in the organization chart (with smaller "level" values)
to be processed first, resulting in a breadth\-first search. The output is:




> ```
> 
> Alice
> ...Bob
> ...Cindy
> ......Dave
> ......Emma
> ......Fred
> ......Gail
> 
> ```


But if we change the ORDER BY clause to add the "DESC" modifier, that will
cause lower levels in the organization (with larger "level" values) to be
processed first by the recursive\-select, resulting in a depth\-first search:




> ```
> 
> WITH RECURSIVE
>   under_alice(name,level) AS (
>     VALUES('Alice',0)
>     UNION ALL
>     SELECT org.name, under_alice.level+1
>       FROM org JOIN under_alice ON org.boss=under_alice.name
>      ORDER BY 2 DESC
>   )
> SELECT substr('..........',1,level*3) || name FROM under_alice;
> 
> ```


The output of this revised query is:




> ```
> 
> Alice
> ...Bob
> ......Dave
> ......Emma
> ...Cindy
> ......Fred
> ......Gail
> 
> ```


When the ORDER BY clause is omitted from the recursive\-select, the
queue behaves as a FIFO, which results in a breadth\-first search.
