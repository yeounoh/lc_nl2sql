# 5\. Limitations And Caveats


* The WITH clause cannot be used within a [CREATE TRIGGER](lang_createtrigger.html).
* The WITH clause must appear at the beginning of a top\-level [SELECT](lang_select.html) statement
or at the beginning of a subquery. The WITH clause cannot be prepended to
the second or subsequent SELECT statement of a [compound select](lang_select.html#compound).
* The SQL:1999 spec requires that the RECURSIVE keyword follow WITH in any
WITH clause that includes a recursive common table expression. However, for
compatibility with SqlServer and Oracle, SQLite does not enforce this rule.
