# 7\. Software Design And Coding Standards


Objective coding standards for SQLite are minimal:



* 2\-space indentation
* No lines over 80 characters in length
* No tabs


All other design and coding rules are subjective. The
goal here is to make the software so that it is readable
and maintainable through the year 2050\. To that end, we look
for succinct yet useful comments (no boilerplate), carefully
chosen variable names, and careful explanation of the meaning
of each data structure and the role of each code block.
