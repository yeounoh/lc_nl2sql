### 5\.3\.5\. Dbsqlfuzz



The dbsqlfuzz module is a 
[libFuzzer](https://www.llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html)\-based fuzzer
for SQLite. Dbsqlfuzz fuzzes both the SQL and the database file at
the same time. Dbsqlfuzz uses a customized mutator.




Dbsqlfuzz seems to work better at finding problems than any other
fuzzer available. For that reason, it is kept private. We do not
want hacker gaining access to this technology.
