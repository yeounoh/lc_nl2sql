# 6\. Software Requirements Standards And Data


In the SQLite project, the "requirements" are the project documentation.
Special markup in the documentation text indentifies individual requirements.
The requirement numbers are based on a cryptographic hash of normalized
requirement text, so that it is impossible to change the requirement text
without also changing the requirement number.



Documentation text (and hence requirement text) is taken from the
SQLite Documentation source repository, described above, and also from
comments in the implementation. The makefiles to build the documentation
are in the documentation source repository.



When the documentation is build, requirements are identified and labeled.
The documentation build process also scans for test cases that verify
each requirement and constructs a matrix showing which requirements have
been testing and identifying the specific test cases that test those
requirements.
