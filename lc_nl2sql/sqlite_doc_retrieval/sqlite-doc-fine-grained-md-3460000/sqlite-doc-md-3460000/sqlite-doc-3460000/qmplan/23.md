# 8\. Problem Reports


All problems are fixed expeditiously. There are no lingering problems
in the sQLite software.



The [Fossil version control system](https://fossil-scm.org/) utilized by
SQLite contains built\-in support for tracking trouble\-tickets. This built\-in
ticket system is used to track and document many historical problems.



The [SQLite Community Forum](https://fossil-scm.org/forum) is a place
where anybody on the internet can go to ask questions about or report bugs
against SQLite. Bugs found by third\-parties are often reported initially
on the Forum. Forum\-reported bugs will sometimes be transferred to tickets,
though recent practice as been to just deal with the bugs on the Forum.
The Forum has an excellent full\-text search feature, is mirrored to
multiple machines, and is just as searchable and survivable as the ticket
system, so it seems unnecessary to duplicate Forum\-originated bug reports
into the ticket system. The public locations of the Forum are:



* Primary location: <https://www.sqlite.org/forum>
* Backup A: [https://www2\.sqlite.org/forum](https://www2.sqlite.org/forum)
* Backup B: [https://www3\.sqlite.org/cgi/forum](https://www3.sqlite.org/cgi/forum)



As with the source repositories, the Forum is also synced to various
private machines.
Note that because of the way Fossil works, the "backups" are more than just
read\-only backups. They can also function as data inputs. All content
entered is synced to all repositories, regardless of which repository is
used for insertion.
