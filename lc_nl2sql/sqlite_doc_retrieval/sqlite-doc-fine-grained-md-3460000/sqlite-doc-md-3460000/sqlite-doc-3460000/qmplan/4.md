## 2\.1\. Software Life Cycle



SQLite uses a continuous integration process. The software
is under constant enhancement and refinement. The latest trunk
check\-ins are frequently used internally for mission\-critical
operations. 




There is no pre\-defined release cycle. Releases occur
when there is a critical mass of feature enhancements and/or
bug fixes. Historically, releases have occurred about 5 or 6
times per year.
Users of SQLite pick up new releases from the website on an
as\-needed basis.
