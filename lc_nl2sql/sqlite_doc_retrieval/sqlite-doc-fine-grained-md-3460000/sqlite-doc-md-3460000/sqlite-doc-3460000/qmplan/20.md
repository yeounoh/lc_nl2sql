## 5\.4\. Software Verification Results



Release testing proceeds by [checklist](testing.html#cklist). The current status and
complete change history for each checklist is stored in a separate
SQLite database file. These files are not version controlled, but
separate copies are maintained on private backup servers.



The source code to the software that runs the checklists is stored
in its own Fossil repository at <https://www.sqlite.org/checklistapp>.
