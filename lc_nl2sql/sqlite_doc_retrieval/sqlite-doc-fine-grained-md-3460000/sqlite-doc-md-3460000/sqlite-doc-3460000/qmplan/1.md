# 1\. Overview



This is the Quality Management Plan for SQLite.




Quality management documents tend to expand into
binders full of incomprehensible jargon that nobody
reads. This document strives to break that pattern by
being concise and useful.




The inspiration for this document is
[DO\-178B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DO-178B).
Among quality standards, DO\-178B seems to have the highest usefulness
to paperwork ratio. Even so, the amount of documentation needed
for a full\-up DO\-178B implementation is vast. SQLite strives to be
nimble and low\-ceremony, and to that end, much of the required
DO\-178B documentation is omitted. We retain only those parts that
genuinely improve quality for an open\-source software project such
as SQLite.




The purpose of this document is to brief the reader on how the
SQLite development team functions on a daily basis, as they continuously
enhance the SQLite software and work to improve its already high reliability.
The document achieves its purpose if a competent developer can be
assimilated into the development team quickly after perusing this
document.
