## 2\.3\. Schedule


SQLite has a long\-range vision.
Planning is done with the assumption that SQLite
will be used and supported through at least the year 2050\.
All code is written with the idea that it will one day be read and
maintained by people not yet born. The code is carefully commented
with an eye toward helping those future developers more easily 
understand the logic and the rationale behind the code.
