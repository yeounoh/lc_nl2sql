# 4\. Software Verification Plan


The testing process for SQLite is described in the [testing](testing.html) document.
Testing objectives include:



* 100% MC/DC in an as\-delivered configuration
* Testing of both source code and object code
* Testing on multiple platforms and with multiple compilers
* Fuzz testing
* Code change inspection
* Dynamic and static analysis of the code


The testing process is controlled by the
[release testing checklists](testing.html#cklist). The checklists succinctly summarize
all steps necessary to fully validate SQLite, and they record when
and by whom each validation step was performed.



The set of checklist items for release checklist is potentially
updated for each release. The content and complete
history of each release checklist are retained for the historical
record.
