### 5\.3\.2\. SQLite Documentation Sources


The documentation sources include documentation text and images with the
scripts and makefile needed to construct the SQLite website documentation.
This document is contained within the documentation sources. The
document sources are kept in a separate repository distinct from the
source code. The documentation sources repository is publicly readable.



The makefiles and scripts used to generate the documentation gather
text from baseline documents in the documentation source repository.
Additional text is extracted from comments in the SQLite source code.
Requirements coverage information is extracted from special comments in the
[TCL test suite](testing.html#tcl) which is part of the source repository, and from
comments in the [TH3](th3.html) test suite which is in a separate private repository.
