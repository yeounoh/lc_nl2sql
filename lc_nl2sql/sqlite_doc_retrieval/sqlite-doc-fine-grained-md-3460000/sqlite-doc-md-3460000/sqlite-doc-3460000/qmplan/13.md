## 5\.2\. Survivability



All code is archived on three separate machines:
<https://www.sqlite.org>, [https://www2\.sqlite.org](https://www2.sqlite.org), [https://www3\.sqlite.org](https://www3.sqlite.org).
These machines are located in different cities (Dallas, Newark, and
San Francisco, respectively) and managed by two different hosting
companies ([Linode](https://linode.com) for the first two and
[Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) for the third).
This diversity is intended to avoid a single point of failure.




The main machine in Dallas <https://www.sqlite.org/> is the primary
server and the one that most people use. The other two are considered
backups.




In addition to the official repositories, the developers typically
keep complete clones of all software on their personal machines.
And there are other clones scattered about the internet.
