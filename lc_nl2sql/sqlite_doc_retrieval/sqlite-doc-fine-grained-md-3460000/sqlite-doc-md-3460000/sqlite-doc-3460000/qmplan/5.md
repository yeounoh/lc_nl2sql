### 2\.1\.1\. Maintenance Releases



Routine maintenance releases of SQLite contain feature enhancements,
performance enhancements, and/or fixes for non\-critical issues.
The version number for major releases are of the form "3\.N.0"
for some integer N. See the [version numbering conventions](versionnumbers.html) document
for details.




Upcoming maintenance releases announced on the sqlite\-users and
sqlite\-dev [mailing lists](support.html#mailinglists) about two weeks prior to the anticipated
release. Approximately one week prior to release, the lead developer
declares "pencils down" after which only bug\-fix check\-ins are
allowed on trunk. A new 
[release checklist](https://sqlite.org/src/ext/checklist/top/index)
is created and updated as needed. As items of the checklist are 
verified, they are checked off and turn green. The release occurs
when all elements of the checklist are green. That process normally
takes about a week.
