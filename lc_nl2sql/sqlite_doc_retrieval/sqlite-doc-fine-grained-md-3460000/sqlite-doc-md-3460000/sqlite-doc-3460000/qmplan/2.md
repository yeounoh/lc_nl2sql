## 1\.1\. About This Document



The quality management plan was originally composed by going through
the description of outputs in section 11 of DO\-178B (pages 48 through 56\)
and writing down those elements that seemed relevant to SQLite.
The text will be subsequent revised to track enhancements to the
SQLite quality process.
