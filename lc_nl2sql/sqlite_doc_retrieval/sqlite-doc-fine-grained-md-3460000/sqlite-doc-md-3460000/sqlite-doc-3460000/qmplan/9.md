# 3\. Software Development Environment



SQLite is written in portable C code.
Development work occurs on a mix of Linux, Mac, and Windows workstations.
The developers use command\-line tools and eschew integrated development
environments (IDEs) whenever possible. All developers are expected to be
fluent with the unix command\-line.




A minimum setup for compiling and testing SQLite from canonical
sources is as follows:



* A host computer with a 32\-bit or 64\-bit address space.
 The OS can be Linux, Mac, Windows, \*BSD, Solaris, or some other.
* A C99 compiler such as GCC (including MinGW variants for Windows),
 Clang, or MSVC
* A text editor of the user's choice supporting UTF\-8 text.
* [Tcl](https://core.tcl.tk/) version 8\.6 or later.
* The "make" utility, or optionally "nmake" on Windows.



The Tcl script language is used to help translate canonical source code
into the [amalgamation](amalgamation.html) and to manage testing. Tcl is not used directly
by SQLite itself (unless requested by a compile\-time option). End users
of the SQLite amalgamation sources do not need Tcl.




When building the [CLI](cli.html), it is helpful, but not required, to have
the following third\-party libraries on hand:



* [zLib](https://zlib.net/)
* [readline](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/readline.git?h=devel)
 or [editline](http://thrysoee.dk/editline/)
 or [linenoise](https://github.com/antirez/linenoise) for
 command\-line editing.



A complete release\-test of SQLite requires additional software,



* [valgrind](http://www.valgrind.org/)
* [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html)



SQLite is expected to operate the same, and use exactly the same 
[on\-disk format](fileformat2.html),
on all modern operating systems, on all modern computer architectures,
and using all modern C compilers. The developers are constantly testing
SQLite on as many diverse platforms as they can get their hands on.
