### 2\.1\.2\. Patch Releases



Occasionally, a serious problem is found and a small "patch" release
must be made against a regular maintenance release. Patches are distinct
from maintenance releases in that the number of lines of code changed
from the previous release is small. Every effort is made to avoid
patch releases by making sure that maintenance releases are bug free.




Patch releases may or may not have a release checklist, depending on the
issue. This is a judgement call by the project leader.
