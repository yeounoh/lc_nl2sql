### 5\.3\.4\. Test Harness \#3



The [Test Harness \#3](th3.html) or [TH3](th3.html) test suite is a private set of
test cases used to test SQLite to 100% MC/DC in an as\-delivered
configuration. TH3 sources are served on the same servers as the
other SQLite repositories, but differ from the others in being
proprietary. The TH3 code is only accessible to SQLite developers.
