# 1\. Introduction



A partial index is an index over a subset of the rows of a table.




In ordinary indexes, there is exactly one entry in the index for every
row in the table. In partial indexes, only some subset of the rows in the
table have corresponding index entries. For example, a partial index might
omit entries for which the column being indexed is NULL. When used 
judiciously, partial indexes can result in smaller database files and
improvements in both query and write performance.
