# 4\. Supported Versions



Partial indexes have been supported in SQLite since [version 3\.8\.0](releaselog/3_8_0.html)
(2013\-08\-26\).



Database files that contain partial indices are not readable or writable
by versions of SQLite prior to 3\.8\.0\. However, a database file created
by SQLite 3\.8\.0 is still readable and writable by prior versions as long
as its schema contains no partial indexes. A database that is unreadable
by legacy versions of SQLite can be made readable simply by running
[DROP INDEX](lang_dropindex.html) on the partial indexes.
