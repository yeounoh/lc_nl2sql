# Page Cache


The B\-tree module requests information from the disk in fixed\-size
pages. The default [page\_size](pragma.html#pragma_page_size) is 4096 bytes but can be any power of
two between 512 and 65536 bytes.
The page cache is responsible for reading, writing, and
caching these pages.
The page cache also provides the rollback and atomic commit abstraction
and takes care of locking of the database file. The
B\-tree driver requests particular pages from the page cache and notifies
the page cache when it wants to modify pages or commit or rollback
changes. The page cache handles all the messy details of making sure
the requests are handled quickly, safely, and efficiently.


The primary page cache implementation is in the
[pager.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/pager.c) file. [WAL mode](wal.html) logic is in the separate
[wal.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/wal.c). In\-memory caching is implemented by the
[pcache.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/pcache.c) and [pcache1\.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/pcache1.c) files.
The interface between page cache subsystem
and the rest of SQLite is defined by the header file [pager.h](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/pager.h).
