# Interface


Much of the [C\-language Interface](c3ref/intro.html) is found in source
files [main.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/main.c), [legacy.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/legacy.c), and
[vdbeapi.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/vdbeapi.c)
though some routines are
scattered about in other files where they can have access to data 
structures with file scope. 
The [sqlite3\_get\_table()](c3ref/free_table.html) routine is implemented in [table.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/table.c).
The [sqlite3\_mprintf()](c3ref/mprintf.html) routine is found in [printf.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/printf.c).
The [sqlite3\_complete()](c3ref/complete.html) interface is in [complete.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/complete.c).
The [TCL Interface](tclsqlite.html) is implemented by [tclsqlite.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/tclsqlite.c).

To avoid name collisions, all external
symbols in the SQLite library begin with the prefix **sqlite3**.
Those symbols that are intended for external use (in other words,
those symbols which form the API for SQLite) add an underscore, and
thus begin with **sqlite3\_**. Extension APIs sometimes add the
extension name prior to the underscore; for example:
**sqlite3rbu\_** or **sqlite3session\_**.
