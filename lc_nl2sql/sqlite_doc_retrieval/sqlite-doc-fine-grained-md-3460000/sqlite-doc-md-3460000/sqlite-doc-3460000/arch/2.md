# Overview


SQLite works by compiling SQL text into [bytecode](opcode.html), then running
that bytecode using a virtual machine.

The [sqlite3\_prepare\_v2()](c3ref/prepare.html) and related interfaces act as a compiler
for converting SQL text into bytecode. The [sqlite3\_stmt](c3ref/stmt.html) object is
a container for a single bytecode program that implements a single
SQL statement. The [sqlite3\_step()](c3ref/step.html) interface passes a bytecode program
into the virtual machine, and runs the program until it either completes,
or forms a row of result to be returned, or hits a fatal error, or is
[interrupted](c3ref/interrupt.html).
