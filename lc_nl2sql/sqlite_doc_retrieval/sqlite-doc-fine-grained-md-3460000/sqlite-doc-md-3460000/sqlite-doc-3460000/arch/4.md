# Tokenizer


When a string containing SQL statements is to be evaluated it is
first sent to the tokenizer.
The tokenizer breaks
the SQL text into tokens and hands those tokens
one by one to the parser. The tokenizer is hand\-coded in 
the file tokenize.c.

Note that in this design, the tokenizer calls the parser. People
who are familiar with YACC and BISON may be accustomed to doing things the
other way around â€” having the parser call the tokenizer. Having
the tokenizer call the parser is better, though, because it can be made
threadsafe and it runs faster.
