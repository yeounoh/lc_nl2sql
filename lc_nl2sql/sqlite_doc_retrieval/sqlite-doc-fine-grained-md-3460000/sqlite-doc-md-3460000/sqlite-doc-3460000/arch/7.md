# Bytecode Engine


The [bytecode](opcode.html) program created by the code generator is run by
a virtual machine.

The virtual machine itself is entirely contained in a single
source file [vdbe.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/vdbe.c). The
[vdbe.h](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/vdbe.h) header file defines an interface
between the virtual machine and the rest of the SQLite library and
[vdbeInt.h](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/vdbeInt.h) which defines structures and interfaces that
are private to the virtual machine itself.
Various other **vdbe\*.c** files are helpers to the virtual machine.
The [vdbeaux.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/vdbeaux.c) file contains utilities used by the virtual
machine and interface modules used by the rest of the library to
construct VM programs. The [vdbeapi.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/vdbeapi.c) file contains external
interfaces to the virtual machine such as the 
[sqlite3\_bind\_int()](c3ref/bind_blob.html) and [sqlite3\_step()](c3ref/step.html). Individual values
(strings, integer, floating point numbers, and BLOBs) are stored
in an internal object named "Mem" which is implemented by
[vdbemem.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/vdbemem.c).



SQLite implements SQL functions using callbacks to C\-language routines.
Even the built\-in SQL functions are implemented this way. Most of
the built\-in SQL functions (ex: [abs()](lang_corefunc.html#abs), [count()](lang_aggfunc.html#count),
[substr()](lang_corefunc.html#substr), and so forth) can be found in [func.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/func.c) source
file.
Date and time conversion functions are found in [date.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/date.c).
Some functions such as [coalesce()](lang_corefunc.html#coalesce) and [typeof()](lang_corefunc.html#typeof) are implemented
as bytecode directly by the code generator.
