# OS Interface



In order to provide portability across operating systems,
SQLite uses an abstract object called the [VFS](vfs.html). Each VFS provides methods
for opening, reading, writing, and closing files on disk, and for other
OS\-specific tasks such as finding the current time, or obtaining randomness
to initialize the built\-in pseudo\-random number generator.
SQLite currently provides VFSes for unix (in the [os\_unix.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/os_unix.c)
file) and Windows (in the [os\_win.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/os_win.c) file).
