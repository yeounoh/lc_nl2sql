# B\-Tree


An SQLite database is maintained on disk using a B\-tree implementation
found in the [btree.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/btree.c) source file. Separate B\-trees are used for
each table and each index in the database. All B\-trees are stored in the
same disk file. The [file format](fileformat2.html) details are stable and well\-defined and
are guaranteed to be compatible moving forward.


The interface to the B\-tree subsystem and the rest of the SQLite library
is defined by the header file [btree.h](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/btree.h).
