# Parser


The parser assigns meaning to tokens based on
their context. The parser for SQLite is generated using the
[Lemon parser generator](lemon.html).
Lemon does the same job as YACC/BISON, but it uses
a different input syntax which is less error\-prone.
Lemon also generates a parser which is reentrant and thread\-safe.
And Lemon defines the concept of a non\-terminal destructor so
that it does not leak memory when syntax errors are encountered.
The grammar file that drives Lemon and that defines the SQL language
that SQLite understands is found in [parse.y](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/parse.y).

Because
Lemon is a program not normally found on development machines, the
complete source code to Lemon (just one C file) is included in the
SQLite distribution in the "tool" subdirectory.
