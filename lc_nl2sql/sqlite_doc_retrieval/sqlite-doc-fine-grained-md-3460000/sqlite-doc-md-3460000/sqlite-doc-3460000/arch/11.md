# Utilities



Memory allocation, caseless string comparison routines, 
portable text\-to\-number conversion routines, and other utilities
are located in [util.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/util.c).
Symbol tables used by the parser are maintained by hash tables found
in [hash.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/hash.c). The [utf.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/utf.c) source file contains Unicode
conversion subroutines.
SQLite has its own private implementation of 
[printf()](printf.html) (with
some extensions) in [printf.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/printf.c) and its own
pseudo\-random number generator (PRNG) in [random.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/random.c).
