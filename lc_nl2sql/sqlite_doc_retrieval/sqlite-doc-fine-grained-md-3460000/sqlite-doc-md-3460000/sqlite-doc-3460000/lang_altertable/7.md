# 6\. Disable Error Checking Using PRAGMA writable\_schema\=ON


ALTER TABLE will normally fail and make no changes if it encounters
any entries in the [sqlite\_schema table](schematab.html) that do not parse. For
example, if there is a malformed VIEW or TRIGGER associated with
table named "tbl1", then an attempt to rename "tbl1" to "tbl1neo" will
fail because the associated views and triggers could not be parsed.



Beginning with SQLite 3\.38\.0 (2022\-02\-22\), this error checking
can be disabled by setting "[PRAGMA writable\_schema\=ON;](pragma.html#pragma_writable_schema)". When
the schema is writable, ALTER TABLE silently ignores any rows of the
sqlite\_schema table that do not parse.
