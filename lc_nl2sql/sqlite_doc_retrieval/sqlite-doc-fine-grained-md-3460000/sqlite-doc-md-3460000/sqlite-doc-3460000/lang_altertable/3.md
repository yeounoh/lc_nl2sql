# 3\. ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN


 The RENAME COLUMN TO syntax changes the
column\-name of table table\-name
into new\-column\-name. The column name is changed both
within the table definition itself and also within all indexes, triggers,
and views that reference the column. If the column name change would
result in a semantic ambiguity in a trigger or view, then the RENAME
COLUMN fails with an error and no changes are applied.
