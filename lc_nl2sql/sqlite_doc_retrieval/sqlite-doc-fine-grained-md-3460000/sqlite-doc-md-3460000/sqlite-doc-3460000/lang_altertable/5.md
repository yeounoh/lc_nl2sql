# 5\. ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN


 The DROP COLUMN syntax
is used to remove an existing column from a table.
The DROP COLUMN command removes the named column from the table,
and rewrites its content to purge the data associated
with that column.
The DROP COLUMN command only works if the column is not referenced
by any other parts of the schema and is not a PRIMARY KEY and
does not have a UNIQUE constraint.
Possible reasons why the DROP COLUMN command can fail include:


* The column is a PRIMARY KEY or part of one.
* The column has a UNIQUE constraint.
* The column is indexed.
* The column is named in the WHERE clause of a [partial index](partialindex.html).
* The column is named in a table or column [CHECK constraint](lang_createtable.html#ckconst)
not associated with the column being dropped.
* The column is used in a [foreign key constraint](foreignkeys.html).
* The column is used in the expression of a [generated column](gencol.html).
* The column appears in a trigger or view.
