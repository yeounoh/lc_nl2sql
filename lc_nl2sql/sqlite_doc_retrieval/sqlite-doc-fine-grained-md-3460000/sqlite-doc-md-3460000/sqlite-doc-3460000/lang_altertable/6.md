## 5\.1\. How It Works


SQLite stores the schema as plain text in the [sqlite\_schema table](schematab.html).
The DROP COLUMN command (and all of the other variations of ALTER TABLE
as well) modify that text and then attempt to reparse the entire schema.
The command is only successful if the schema is still valid after the
text has been modified. In the case of the DROP COLUMN command, the
only text modified is that the column definition is removed from the
CREATE TABLE statement. The DROP COLUMN command will fail if there
are any traces of the column in other parts of the schema that will
prevent the schema from parsing after the CREATE TABLE statement has
been modified.
