### What Is SQLite?


SQLite is a C\-language library that implements a
[small](footprint.html),
[fast](fasterthanfs.html),
[self\-contained](selfcontained.html),
[high\-reliability](hirely.html),
[full\-featured](fullsql.html),
SQL database engine.
SQLite is the [most used](mostdeployed.html) database engine in the world.
SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and
comes bundled inside countless other applications that people
use every day.

The SQLite [file format](fileformat2.html) is stable, cross\-platform, and
backwards compatible and the developers pledge to keep it
that way [through the year 2050](lts.html). SQLite database
files are commonly used as containers to transfer rich
content between systems
[\[1]](aff_short.html)
[\[2]](sqlar.html)
[\[3]](appfileformat.html)
and as a long\-term archival format
for data
[\[4]](locrsf.html).
There are over 1 trillion (1e12\)
SQLite databases in active use
[\[5]](mostdeployed.html).


SQLite [source code](https://sqlite.org/src)
is in the [public\-domain](copyright.html) and is free to
everyone to use for any purpose.
