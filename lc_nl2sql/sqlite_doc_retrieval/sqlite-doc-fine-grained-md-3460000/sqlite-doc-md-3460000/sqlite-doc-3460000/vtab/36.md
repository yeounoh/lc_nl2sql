#### 2\.3\.1\.2\. LIMIT and OFFSET


When aConstraint\[].op is one of SQLITE\_INDEX\_CONSTRAINT\_LIMIT or
SQLITE\_INDEX\_CONSTRAINT\_OFFSET, that indicates that there is a
LIMIT or OFFSET clause on the SQL query statement that is using
the virtual table. The LIMIT and OFFSET operators have no
left operand, and so when aConstraint\[].op is one of
SQLITE\_INDEX\_CONSTRAINT\_LIMIT or SQLITE\_INDEX\_CONSTRAINT\_OFFSET
then the aConstraint\[].iColumn value is meaningless and should
not be used.
