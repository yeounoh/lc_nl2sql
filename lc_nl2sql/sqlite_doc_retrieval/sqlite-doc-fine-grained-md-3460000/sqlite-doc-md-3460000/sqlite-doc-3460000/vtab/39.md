#### 2\.3\.2\.1\. Omit constraint checking in bytecode


By default, the SQLite generates [bytecode](opcode.html) that will double
checks all constraints on each row of the virtual table to verify
that they are satisfied. If the virtual table can guarantee
that a constraint will always be satisfied, it can try to
suppress that double\-check by setting aConstraintUsage\[].omit.
However, with some exceptions, this is only a hint and
there is no guarantee that the redundant check of the constraint
will be suppressed. Key points:



* The omit flag is only honored if the argvIndex value for the
constraint is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 16\. 
Constraint checking is never suppressed for constraints
that do not pass their right operand into the xFilter method.
The current implementation is only able to suppress redundant
constraint checking for the first 16 values passed to xFilter,
though that limitation might be increased in future releases.
* The omit flag is always honored for [SQLITE\_INDEX\_CONSTRAINT\_OFFSET](c3ref/c_index_constraint_eq.html)
constraints as long as argvIndex is greater than 0\. Setting the
omit flag on an SQLITE\_INDEX\_CONSTRAINT\_OFFSET constraint indicates
to SQLite that the virtual table will itself suppress the first N
rows of output, where N is the right operand of the OFFSET operator.
If the virtual table implementation sets omit on an
SQLITE\_INDEX\_CONSTRAINT\_OFFSET constraint but then fails to suppress
the first N rows of output, an incorrect answer will result from
the overall query.
