## 2\.6\. The xOpen Method



```
int (*xOpen)(sqlite3_vtab *pVTab, sqlite3_vtab_cursor **ppCursor);

```

The xOpen method creates a new cursor used for accessing (read and/or
writing) a virtual table. A successful invocation of this method 
will allocate the memory for the [sqlite3\_vtab\_cursor](c3ref/vtab_cursor.html) (or a subclass),
initialize the new object, and make \*ppCursor point to the new object.
The successful call then returns [SQLITE\_OK](rescode.html#ok).



For every successful call to this method, the SQLite core will
later invoke the [xClose](vtab.html#xclose) method to destroy 
the allocated cursor.



The xOpen method need not initialize the pVtab field of the
[sqlite3\_vtab\_cursor](c3ref/vtab_cursor.html) structure. The SQLite core will take care
of that chore automatically.



A virtual table implementation must be able to support an arbitrary
number of simultaneously open cursors.



When initially opened, the cursor is in an undefined state.
The SQLite core will invoke the [xFilter](vtab.html#xfilter) method
on the cursor prior to any attempt to position or read from the cursor.



The xOpen method is required for every virtual table implementation.
