#### 2\.3\.1\.1\. LIKE, GLOB, REGEXP, and MATCH functions


For the LIKE, GLOB, REGEXP, and MATCH operators, the 
aConstraint\[].iColumn value is the virtual table column that
is the left operand of the operator. However, if these operators
are expressed as function calls instead of operators, then
the aConstraint\[].iColumn value references the virtual table
column that is the second argument to that function:




> LIKE(*EXPR*, *column*)  
> 
> GLOB(*EXPR*, *column*)  
> 
> REGEXP(*EXPR*, *column*)  
> 
> MATCH(*EXPR*, *column*)


Hence, as far as the xBestIndex() method is concerned, the following
two forms are equivalent:




> *column* LIKE *EXPR*  
> 
> LIKE(*EXPR*,*column*)


This special behavior of looking at the second argument of a function
only occurs for the LIKE, GLOB, REGEXP, and MATCH functions. For all
other functions, the aConstraint\[].iColumn value references the first
argument of the function.



This special feature of LIKE, GLOB, REGEXP, and MATCH does not
apply to the [xFindFunction()](vtab.html#xfindfunction) method, however. The
[xFindFunction()](vtab.html#xfindfunction) method always keys off of the left operand of an
LIKE, GLOB, REGEXP, or MATCH operator but off of the first argument
to function\-call equivalents of those operators.
