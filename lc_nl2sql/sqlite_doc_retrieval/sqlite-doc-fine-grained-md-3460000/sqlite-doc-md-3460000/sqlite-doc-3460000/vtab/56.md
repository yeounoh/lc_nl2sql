## 2\.17\. The xCommit Method



```
int (*xCommit)(sqlite3_vtab *pVTab);

```

This method causes a virtual table transaction to commit.
This is method is optional. The xCommit pointer of [sqlite3\_module](c3ref/module.html)
may be NULL.



A call to this method always follows a prior call to [xBegin](vtab.html#xBegin) and
[xSync](vtab.html#xsync).
