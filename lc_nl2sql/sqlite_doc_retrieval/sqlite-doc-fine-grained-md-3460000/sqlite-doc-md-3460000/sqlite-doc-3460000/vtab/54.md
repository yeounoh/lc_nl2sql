## 2\.15\. The xBegin Method



```
int (*xBegin)(sqlite3_vtab *pVTab);

```

This method begins a transaction on a virtual table.
This is method is optional. The xBegin pointer of [sqlite3\_module](c3ref/module.html)
may be NULL.



This method is always followed by one call to either the
[xCommit](vtab.html#xcommit) or [xRollback](vtab.html#xrollback) method. Virtual table transactions do
not nest, so the xBegin method will not be invoked more than once
on a single virtual table
without an intervening call to either [xCommit](vtab.html#xcommit) or [xRollback](vtab.html#xrollback).
Multiple calls to other methods can and likely will occur in between
the xBegin and the corresponding [xCommit](vtab.html#xcommit) or [xRollback](vtab.html#xrollback).
