#### 2\.3\.1\.3\. Right\-hand side values of constraints


The [sqlite3\_vtab\_rhs\_value()](c3ref/vtab_rhs_value.html) interface can be used to try to
access the right\-hand operand of a constraint. However, the value
of a right\-hand operator might not be known at the time that
the xBestIndex method is run, so the sqlite3\_vtab\_rhs\_value()
call might not be successful. Usually the right operand of a
constraint is only available to xBestIndex if it is coded as
a literal value in the input SQL. If the right operand is
coded as an expression or a [host parameter](c3ref/bind_blob.html), it probably will
not be accessible to xBestIndex. Some operators, such as
[SQLITE\_INDEX\_CONSTRAINT\_ISNULL](c3ref/c_index_constraint_eq.html) and
[SQLITE\_INDEX\_CONSTRAINT\_ISNOTNULL](c3ref/c_index_constraint_eq.html) have no right\-hand operand.
The sqlite3\_vtab\_rhs\_value() interface always returns
[SQLITE\_NOTFOUND](rescode.html#notfound) for such operators.
