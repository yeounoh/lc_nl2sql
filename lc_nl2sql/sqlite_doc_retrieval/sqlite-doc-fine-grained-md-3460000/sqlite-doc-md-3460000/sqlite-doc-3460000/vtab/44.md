## 2\.5\. The xDestroy Method



```
int (*xDestroy)(sqlite3_vtab *pVTab);

```

This method releases a connection to a virtual table, just like 
the [xDisconnect](vtab.html#xdisconnect) method, and it also destroys the underlying 
table implementation. This method undoes the work of [xCreate](vtab.html#xcreate).



The [xDisconnect](vtab.html#xdisconnect) method is called whenever a database connection
that uses a virtual table is closed. The xDestroy method is only 
called when a [DROP TABLE](lang_droptable.html) statement is executed against the virtual table.



The xDestroy method is required for every virtual table implementation,
though it is acceptable for the [xDisconnect](vtab.html#xdisconnect) and xDestroy methods to be
the same function if that makes sense for the particular virtual table.
