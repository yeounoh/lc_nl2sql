### 2\.1\.1\. Hidden columns in virtual tables


If a column datatype contains the special keyword "HIDDEN"
(in any combination of upper and lower case letters) then that keyword
it is omitted from the column datatype name and the column is marked 
as a hidden column internally. 
A hidden column differs from a normal column in three respects:






* Hidden columns are not listed in the dataset returned by 
 "[PRAGMA table\_info](pragma.html#pragma_table_info)",
* Hidden columns are not included in the expansion of a "\*"
 expression in the result set of a [SELECT](lang_select.html), and
* Hidden columns are not included in the implicit column\-list 
 used by an [INSERT](lang_insert.html) statement that lacks an explicit column\-list.


For example, if the following SQL is passed to [sqlite3\_declare\_vtab()](c3ref/declare_vtab.html):




```
CREATE TABLE x(a HIDDEN VARCHAR(12), b INTEGER, c INTEGER Hidden);

```

Then the virtual table would be created with two hidden columns,
and with datatypes of "VARCHAR(12\)" and "INTEGER".



An example use of hidden columns can be seen in the [FTS3](fts3.html) virtual 
table implementation, where every FTS virtual table
contains an [FTS hidden column](fts3.html#hiddencol) that is used to pass information from the
virtual table into [FTS auxiliary functions](fts3.html#snippet) and to the [FTS MATCH](fts3.html#full_text_index_queries) operator.
