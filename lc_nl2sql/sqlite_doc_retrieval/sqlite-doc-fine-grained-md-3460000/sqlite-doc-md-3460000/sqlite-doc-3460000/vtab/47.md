## 2\.8\. The xEof Method



```
int (*xEof)(sqlite3_vtab_cursor*);

```

The xEof method must return false (zero) if the specified cursor 
currently points to a valid row of data, or true (non\-zero) otherwise. 
This method is called by the SQL engine immediately after each 
[xFilter](vtab.html#xfilter) and [xNext](vtab.html#xnext) invocation.



The xEof method is required for every virtual table implementation.
