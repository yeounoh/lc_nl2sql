## 2\.4\. The xDisconnect Method



```
int (*xDisconnect)(sqlite3_vtab *pVTab);

```

This method releases a connection to a virtual table. 
Only the [sqlite3\_vtab](c3ref/vtab.html) object is destroyed.
The virtual table is not destroyed and any backing store 
associated with the virtual table persists. 

This method undoes the work of [xConnect](vtab.html#xconnect).



This method is a destructor for a connection to the virtual table.
Contrast this method with [xDestroy](vtab.html#sqlite3_module.xDestroy). The xDestroy is a destructor
for the entire virtual table.



The xDisconnect method is required for every virtual table implementation,
though it is acceptable for the xDisconnect and [xDestroy](vtab.html#sqlite3_module.xDestroy) methods to be
the same function if that makes sense for the particular virtual table.
