### 2\.1\.2\. Table\-valued functions


A [virtual table](vtab.html) that contains [hidden columns](vtab.html#hiddencol) can be used like
a table\-valued function in the FROM clause of a [SELECT](lang_select.html) statement.
The arguments to the table\-valued function become constraints on 
the HIDDEN columns of the virtual table.



For example, the "generate\_series" extension (located in the
[ext/misc/series.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/artifact?ci=trunk&filename=ext/misc/series.c)
file in the [source tree](https://www.sqlite.org/src/tree?ci=trunk))
implements an [eponymous virtual table](vtab.html#epovtab) with the following schema:




```
CREATE TABLE generate_series(
  value,
  start HIDDEN,
  stop HIDDEN,
  step HIDDEN
);

```

The [sqlite3\_module.xBestIndex](vtab.html#xbestindex) method in the implementation of this
table checks for equality constraints against the HIDDEN columns, and uses
those as input parameters to determine the range of integer "value" outputs
to generate. Reasonable defaults are used for any unconstrained columns.
For example, to list all integers between 5 and 50:




```
SELECT value FROM generate_series(5,50);

```

The previous query is equivalent to the following:




```
SELECT value FROM generate_series WHERE start=5 AND stop=50;

```

Arguments on the virtual table name are matched to [hidden columns](vtab.html#hiddencol)
in order. The number of arguments can be less than the
number of hidden columns, in which case the latter hidden columns are
unconstrained. However, an error results if there are more arguments
than there are hidden columns in the virtual table.
