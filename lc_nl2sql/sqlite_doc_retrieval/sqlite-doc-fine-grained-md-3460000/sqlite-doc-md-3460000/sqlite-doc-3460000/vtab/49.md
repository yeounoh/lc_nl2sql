## 2\.10\. The xNext Method



```
int (*xNext)(sqlite3_vtab_cursor*);

```

The xNext method advances a [virtual table cursor](c3ref/vtab_cursor.html)
to the next row of a result set initiated by [xFilter](vtab.html#xfilter). 
If the cursor is already pointing at the last row when this 
routine is called, then the cursor no longer points to valid 
data and a subsequent call to the [xEof](vtab.html#xeof) method must return true (non\-zero). 
If the cursor is successfully advanced to another row of content, then
subsequent calls to [xEof](vtab.html#xeof) must return false (zero).



This method must return [SQLITE\_OK](rescode.html#ok) if successful, or an sqlite 
[error code](rescode.html) if an error occurs.



The xNext method is required for every virtual table implementation.
