## 2\.16\. The xSync Method



```
int (*xSync)(sqlite3_vtab *pVTab);

```

This method signals the start of a two\-phase commit on a virtual
table.
This is method is optional. The xSync pointer of [sqlite3\_module](c3ref/module.html)
may be NULL.



This method is only invoked after call to the [xBegin](vtab.html#xBegin) method and
prior to an [xCommit](vtab.html#xcommit) or [xRollback](vtab.html#xrollback). In order to implement two\-phase
commit, the xSync method on all virtual tables is invoked prior to
invoking the [xCommit](vtab.html#xcommit) method on any virtual table. If any of the 
xSync methods fail, the entire transaction is rolled back.
