## 2\.7\. The xClose Method



```
int (*xClose)(sqlite3_vtab_cursor*);

```

The xClose method closes a cursor previously opened by 
[xOpen](vtab.html#xopen). 
The SQLite core will always call xClose once for each cursor opened 
using xOpen.



This method must release all resources allocated by the
corresponding xOpen call. The routine will not be called again even if it
returns an error. The SQLite core will not use the
[sqlite3\_vtab\_cursor](c3ref/vtab_cursor.html) again after it has been closed.



The xClose method is required for every virtual table implementation.
