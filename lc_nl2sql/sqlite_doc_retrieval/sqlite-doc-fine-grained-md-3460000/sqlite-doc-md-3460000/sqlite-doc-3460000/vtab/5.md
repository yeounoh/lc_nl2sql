### 1\.1\.3\. Eponymous\-only virtual tables


If the [xCreate](vtab.html#xcreate) method is NULL, then
[CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE](lang_createvtab.html) statements are prohibited for that virtual table,
and the virtual table is an "eponymous\-only virtual table".
Eponymous\-only virtual tables are useful as 
[table\-valued functions](vtab.html#tabfunc2).




Note that prior to [version 3\.9\.0](releaselog/3_9_0.html) (2015\-10\-14\), 
SQLite did not check the xCreate method
for NULL before invoking it. So if an eponymous\-only virtual table is
registered with SQLite [version 3\.8\.11\.1](releaselog/3_8_11_1.html) (2015\-07\-29\)
or earlier and a [CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE](lang_createvtab.html)
command is attempted against that virtual table module, a jump to a NULL
pointer will occur, resulting in a crash.
