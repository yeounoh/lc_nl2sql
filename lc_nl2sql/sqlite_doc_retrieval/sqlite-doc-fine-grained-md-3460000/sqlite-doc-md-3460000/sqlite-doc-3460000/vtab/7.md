## 1\.3\. Virtual Tables And Shared Cache


Prior to SQLite [version 3\.6\.17](releaselog/3_6_17.html) (2009\-08\-10\), 
the virtual table mechanism assumes 
that each [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html) kept
its own copy of the database schema. Hence, the virtual table mechanism
could not be used in a database that has [shared cache mode](sharedcache.html) enabled. 
The [sqlite3\_create\_module()](c3ref/create_module.html) interface would return an error if 
[shared cache mode](sharedcache.html) is enabled. That restriction was relaxed
beginning with SQLite [version 3\.6\.17](releaselog/3_6_17.html).
