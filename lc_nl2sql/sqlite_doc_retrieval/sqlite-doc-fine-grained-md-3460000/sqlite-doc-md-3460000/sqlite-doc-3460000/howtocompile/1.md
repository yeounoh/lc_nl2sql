## Overview



SQLite is ANSI\-C source code.
It must be compiled into machine code before it is useful.
This article is a guide to the various ways of compiling SQLite.



This article does not contain a step\-by\-step recipe for compiling
SQLite. That would be difficult since each development situation
is different.
Rather, this article describes and illustrates the principles behind the
compilation of SQLite. Typical compilation commands are provided as examples
with the expectation that application developers can use these examples
as guidance for developing their own custom compilation procedures.
In other words, this article provides ideas and insights, not turnkey
solutions.
