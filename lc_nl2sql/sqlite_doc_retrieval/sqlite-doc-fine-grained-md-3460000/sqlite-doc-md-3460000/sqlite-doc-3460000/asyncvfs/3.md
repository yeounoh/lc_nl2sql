### 1\.1 How it Works


Asynchronous I/O works by creating an SQLite [VFS object](c3ref/vfs.html)
and registering it with [sqlite3\_vfs\_register()](c3ref/vfs_find.html).
When files opened via 
this VFS are written to (using the vfs xWrite() method), the data is not 
written directly to disk, but is placed in the "write\-queue" to be
handled by the background thread.

When files opened with the asynchronous VFS are read from 
(using the vfs xRead() method), the data is read from the file on 
disk and the write\-queue, so that from the point of view of
the vfs reader the xWrite() appears to have already completed.

The asynchronous I/O VFS is registered (and unregistered) by calls to the 
API functions sqlite3async\_initialize() and sqlite3async\_shutdown().
See section "Compilation and Usage" below for details.
