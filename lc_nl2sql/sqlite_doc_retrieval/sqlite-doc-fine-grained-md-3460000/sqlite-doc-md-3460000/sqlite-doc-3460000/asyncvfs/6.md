## 2\.0 COMPILATION AND USAGE



The asynchronous IO extension consists of a single file of C code
(sqlite3async.c), and a header file (sqlite3async.h), located in the
[ext/async/ subfolder](https://www.sqlite.org/src/dir?name=ext/async) of the SQLite source tree, that defines the 
C API used by applications to activate and control the modules 
functionality.


To use the asynchronous IO extension, compile sqlite3async.c as
part of the application that uses SQLite. Then use the APIs defined
in sqlite3async.h to initialize and configure the module.


The asynchronous IO VFS API is described in detail in comments in 
sqlite3async.h. Using the API usually consists of the following steps:

1. Register the asynchronous IO VFS with SQLite by calling the
 sqlite3async\_initialize() function.

- Create a background thread to perform write operations and call
 sqlite3async\_run().

- Use the normal SQLite API to read and write to databases via 
 the asynchronous IO VFS.


Refer to comments in the
[sqlite3async.h header file](https://www.sqlite.org/src/finfo?name=ext/async/sqlite3async.h) for details.
