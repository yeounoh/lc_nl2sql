## 1\.0 FUNCTIONALITY


With asynchronous I/O, write requests are handled by a separate thread
running in the background. This means that the thread that initiates
a database write does not have to wait for (sometimes slow) disk I/O
to occur. The write seems to happen very quickly, though in reality
it is happening at its usual slow pace in the background.

Asynchronous I/O appears to give better responsiveness, but at a price.
You lose the Durable property. With the default I/O backend of SQLite,
once a write completes, you know that the information you wrote is
safely on disk. With the asynchronous I/O, this is not the case. If
your program crashes or if a power loss occurs after the database
write but before the asynchronous write thread has completed, then the
database change might never make it to disk and the next user of the
database might not see your change.

You lose Durability with asynchronous I/O, but you still retain the
other parts of ACID: Atomic, Consistent, and Isolated. Many
applications get along fine without the Durability.
