## 3\.0 PORTING


Currently the asynchronous IO extension is compatible with win32 systems
and systems that support the pthreads interface, including Mac OS X, Linux, 
and other varieties of Unix. 

To port the asynchronous IO extension to another platform, the user must
implement mutex and condition variable primitives for the new platform.
Currently there is no externally available interface to allow this, but
modifying the code within sqlite3async.c to include the new platforms
concurrency primitives is relatively easy. Search within sqlite3async.c
for the comment string "PORTING FUNCTIONS" for details. Then implement
new versions of each of the following:


> ```
> 
> static void async_mutex_enter(int eMutex);
> static void async_mutex_leave(int eMutex);
> static void async_cond_wait(int eCond, int eMutex);
> static void async_cond_signal(int eCond);
> static void async_sched_yield(void);
> 
> ```


The functionality required of each of the above functions is described
in comments in sqlite3async.c.
