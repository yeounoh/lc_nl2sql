# An Asynchronous I/O Module For SQLite




---


**NOTE:**
[WAL mode](wal.html) with [PRAGMA synchronous](pragma.html#pragma_synchronous) set to NORMAL avoids calls to
fsync() during transaction commit and only invokes fsync() during
a [checkpoint](wal.html#ckpt) operation. The use of [WAL mode](wal.html) largely obviates the
need for this asynchronous I/O module. Hence, this module is no longer
supported. The source code continues to exist in the SQLite source tree,
but it is not a part of any standard build and is no longer maintained.
This documentation is retained for historical reference.

Normally, when SQLite writes to a database file, it waits until the write
operation is finished before returning control to the calling application.
Since writing to the file\-system is usually very slow compared with CPU
bound operations, this can be a performance bottleneck. The asynchronous I/O
backend is an extension that causes SQLite to perform all write requests
using a separate thread running in the background. Although this does not
reduce the overall system resources (CPU, disk bandwidth etc.), it does
allow SQLite to return control to the caller quickly even when writing to
the database.
