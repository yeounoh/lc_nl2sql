### 1\.2 Limitations


In order to gain experience with the main ideas surrounding asynchronous 
IO, this implementation is deliberately kept simple. Additional 
capabilities may be added in the future.

For example, as currently implemented, if writes are happening at a 
steady stream that exceeds the I/O capability of the background writer
thread, the queue of pending write operations will grow without bound.
If this goes on for long enough, the host system could run out of memory. 
A more sophisticated module could to keep track of the quantity of 
pending writes and stop accepting new write requests when the queue of 
pending writes grows too large.
