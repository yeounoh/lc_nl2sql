# 1\. Overview



The SQLITE\_STMT extension implements an [eponymous\-only virtual table](vtab.html#epoonlyvtab) that
provides information about all [prepared statements](c3ref/stmt.html) associated with
the [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html).




The SQLITE\_STMT extension is included in the [amalgamation](amalgamation.html) though 
it is disabled
by default. Use the [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STMTVTAB](compile.html#enable_stmtvtab) compile\-time option to enable
the SQLITE\_STMT extension. The SQLITE\_STMT extension can also be 
loaded at run\-time
by compiling the extension into a shared library or DLL using the source
code at <https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/stmt.c> and following the
instructions for how to [compile loadable extensions](loadext.html#build).




The SQLITE\_STMT extension is enabled in default builds
of the [command\-line shell](cli.html).
