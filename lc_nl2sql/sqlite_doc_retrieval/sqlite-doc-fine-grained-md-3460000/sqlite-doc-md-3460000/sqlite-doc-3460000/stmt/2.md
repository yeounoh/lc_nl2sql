# 2\. Usage



The SQLITE\_STMT virtual table is a read\-only table that can be directly
queried to access information about all prepared statements on the 
current database connection. For example:




```
SELECT * FROM sqlite_stmt;

```


A statement such as the above can be run immediately prior to invoking
[sqlite3\_close()](c3ref/close.html) to confirm that all prepared statements have been 
[finalized](c3ref/finalize.html) and to help identify and track down prepared
statements that have "leaked" and missed finalization.




The SQLITE\_STMT virtual table can also be used to access performance
information about prepared statements, to aid in optimization an application.
For example,
to find out how much memory is being used by [prepared statements](c3ref/stmt.html) that have
never been used, one could run:




```
SELECT sum(mem) FROM sqlite_stmt WHERE run=0;

```
