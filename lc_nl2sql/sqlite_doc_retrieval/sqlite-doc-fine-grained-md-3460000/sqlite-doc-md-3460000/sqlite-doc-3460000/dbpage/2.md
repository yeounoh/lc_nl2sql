# 2\. Usage



The SQLITE\_DBPAGE virtual table read/write table that provides direct
access to the underlying disk file on a page\-by\-page basis. The
virtual table appears to have a schema like this:




```
CREATE TABLE sqlite_dbpage(
  pgno INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  data BLOB
);

```


An SQLite database file is divided into pages.
The first page is 1, the second page is 2, and so forth.
There is no page 0\.
Every page is the same size.
The size of every page is a power of 2 between 512 and 65536\.
See the [file format](fileformat2.html) documentation for further details.




The SQLITE\_DBPAGE table allows an application to view or replace the
raw binary content of each page of the database file.
No attempt is made to interpret the content of the page.
Content is returned byte\-for\-byte as it appears on disk.




The SQLITE\_DBPAGE table has one row for each page in the database file.
SQLITE\_DBPAGE allows pages to be read or to be overwritten.
However the size of the database file cannot be changed. It is not
possible to change the number of rows in the SQLITE\_DBPAGE table by
running DELETE or INSERT operations against that table.
