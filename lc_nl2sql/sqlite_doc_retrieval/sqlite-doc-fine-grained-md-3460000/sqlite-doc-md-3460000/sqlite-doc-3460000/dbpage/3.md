## 2\.1\. Using SQLITE\_DBPAGE On ATTACH\-ed Databases



The SQLITE\_DBPAGE table schema shown above is incomplete. There is
a third [hidden column](vtab.html#hiddencol) named "schema" that determines which
[ATTACH\-ed database](lang_attach.html) should be read or written. Because
the "schema" column is hidden, it can be used as a parameter when
SQLITE\_DBPAGE is invoked as a [table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2).




For example, suppose an additional database is attached to the 
database connection using a statement like this:




```
ATTACH 'auxdata1.db' AS aux1;

```


Then to read the first page of that database file, one merely runs:




```
SELECT data FROM sqlite_dbpage('aux1') WHERE pgno=1;

```


If the "schema" is omitted, it defaults to the primary database
(usually called 'main', unless renamed using [SQLITE\_DBCONFIG\_MAINDBNAME](c3ref/c_dbconfig_defensive.html#sqlitedbconfigmaindbname)).
Hence, the following two queries are normally equivalent:




```
SELECT data FROM sqlite_dbpage('main') WHERE pgno=1;
SELECT data FROM sqlite_dbpage WHERE pgno=1;

```


The SQLITE\_DBPAGE table can participate in a join just like any other
table. Hence, to see the content of the first page to all connected
database files, one might run a statement like this:




```
SELECT dbpage.data, dblist.name
  FROM pragma_database_list AS dblist
  JOIN sqlite_dbpage(dblist.name) AS dbpage
 WHERE dbpage.pgno=1;

```
