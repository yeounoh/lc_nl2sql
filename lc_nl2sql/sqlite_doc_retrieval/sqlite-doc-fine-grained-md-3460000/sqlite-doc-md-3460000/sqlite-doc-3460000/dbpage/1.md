# 1\. Overview



The SQLITE\_DBPAGE extension implements an [eponymous\-only virtual table](vtab.html#epoonlyvtab) that
provides direct access to the underlying database file by interacting
with the pager. SQLITE\_DBPAGE is capable of both reading and writing any
page of the database. Because interaction is through the pager layer, all
changes are transactional.




**Warning:** writing to the SQLITE\_DBPAGE virtual table can very easily
cause unrecoverably database corruption. Do not allow untrusted components
to access the SQLITE\_DBPAGE table. Use appropriate care while using the
SQLITE\_DBPAGE table. Back up important data prior to experimenting with the
SQLITE\_DBPAGE table. Writes to the SQLITE\_DBPAGE virtual table are
disabled when the [SQLITE\_DBCONFIG\_DEFENSIVE](c3ref/c_dbconfig_defensive.html#sqlitedbconfigdefensive) flag is set.




The SQLITE\_DBPAGE extension is included in the [amalgamation](amalgamation.html) though 
it is disabled
by default. Use the [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_DBPAGE\_VTAB](compile.html#enable_dbpage_vtab) compile\-time option to enable
the SQLITE\_DBPAGE extension. The SQLITE\_DBPAGE extension makes use of
unpublished internal interfaces and is not run\-time loadable. The only way
to add SQLITE\_DBPAGE to an application is to compile it in using the
[SQLITE\_ENABLE\_DBPAGE\_VTAB](compile.html#enable_dbpage_vtab) compile\-time option.




The SQLITE\_DBPAGE extension is enabled in default builds
of the [command\-line shell](cli.html).
