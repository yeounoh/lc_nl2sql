# 1\. Garbage In, Garbage Out



With regard to invalid UTF, SQLite follows a policy of
Garbage\-In, Garbage\-Out (GIGO). If you insert invalid UTF
into an SQLite database, then try to query that data, what you get back out
might not be exactly what you put in. If you put garbage in, then you
may not complain if you get different garbage back out.




For the purposes of this discussion, "invalid UTF" can mean any of
the following circumstances:



* Invalid surrogate pairs in UTF\-16\.
* Invalid multi\-byte sequences in UTF\-8\.
* Using more bytes of UTF\-8 than necessary to represent a single
code point. (Example: encoding 'A' as the two\-byte sequence
0xc1, 0x01 instead of just a single 0x41 byte.)
* NUL characters (U\+0000\) embedded in strings.
* Invalid sequences of combining characters.
* UTF\-8 or UTF\-16 bytes sequences that encode numbers that are not
defined Unicode characters.
