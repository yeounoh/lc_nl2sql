## 1\.1\. Invalid UTF will never cause memory errors



If you insert invalid UTF into an SQLite database, then SQLite makes
no guarantees about what text you might get back out. But it does
promise that invalid UTF will never cause memory errors
(array overruns, reads or writes of uninitialized memory, etc), at
least for the built\-in processing of SQLite.
In other words, invalid UTF will not cause SQLite to crash.




This promise only applies to the core SQLite components, not
application\-provided extensions, of course.
If an application adds new application\-defined SQL functions or
virtual tables or collating sequences or other extensions, and a
database contains invalid UTF, then invalid UTF might get passed
into those extensions. If the invalid UTF causes one of those
extensions to crash, then that is a problem with the extension,
not with SQLite.
