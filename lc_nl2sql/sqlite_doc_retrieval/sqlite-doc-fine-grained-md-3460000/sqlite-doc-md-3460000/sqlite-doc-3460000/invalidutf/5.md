# 4\. Invalid UTF in the database schema



If a database schema contains names (table names, column names, index
names, and so forth) that are invalid UTF, SQLite will continue to
operate normally. As far as SQLite is concerned, those names are just
byte sequences. SQLite does not care whether they are valid UTF or not.




When generating error messages (using, for example, [sqlite3\_errmsg()](c3ref/errcode.html)),
sometimes SQLite will embedded parts of the database schema into the
error message. If those embedded schema elements
are invalid UTF, then the resulting error message might also be
invalid UTF.
Similarly, the output from the [PRAGMA integrity\_check](pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check) and similar
statements will sometimes embed the names of schema elements. If those
schema element names are invalid UTF, then the output of the command
will also be invalid UTF.
