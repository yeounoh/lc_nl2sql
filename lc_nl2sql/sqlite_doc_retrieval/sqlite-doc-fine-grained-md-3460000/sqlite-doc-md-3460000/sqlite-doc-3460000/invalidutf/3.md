# 2\. No enforcement of text formatting rules



SQLite does not try to enforce UTF formatting rules. You can
insert invalid UTF into a TEXT field and SQLite will not complain
about this. It stores the invalid TEXT as best it can. SQLite
sees its role in the world as a storage engine, not a text format
validation engine.
