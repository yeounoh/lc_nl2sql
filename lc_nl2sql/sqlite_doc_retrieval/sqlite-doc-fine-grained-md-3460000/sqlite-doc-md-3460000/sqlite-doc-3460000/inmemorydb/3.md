## Temporary Databases


When the name of the database file handed to [sqlite3\_open()](c3ref/open.html) or to
[ATTACH](lang_attach.html) is an empty string, then a new temporary file is created to hold
the database.



> ```
> 
> rc = sqlite3_open("", &db);
> 
> ```



> ```
> 
> ATTACH DATABASE '' AS aux2;
> 
> ```


A different temporary file is created each time so that, just as
with the special ":memory:" string, two database connections to temporary
databases each have their own private database. Temporary databases are
automatically deleted when the connection that created them closes.


Even though a disk file is allocated for each temporary database, in
practice the temporary database usually resides in the in\-memory pager cache
and hence there is very little difference between a pure in\-memory database
created by ":memory:" and a temporary database created by an empty filename.
The sole difference is that a ":memory:" database must remain in memory
at all times whereas parts of a temporary database might be flushed to disk
if the database becomes large or if SQLite comes under memory pressure.


The previous paragraphs describe the behavior of temporary databases
under the default SQLite configuration. An application can use the
[temp\_store pragma](pragma.html#pragma_temp_store) and the [SQLITE\_TEMP\_STORE](compile.html#temp_store) compile\-time parameter to
force temporary databases to behave as pure in\-memory databases, if desired.
