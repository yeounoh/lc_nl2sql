# 4\. History


UPSERT syntax was added to SQLite with version 3\.24\.0 (2018\-06\-04\).
The original implementation closely followed the PostgreSQL syntax in that
it only permitted a single ON CONFLICT clause and it required a
conflict target for on DO UPDATE.
The syntax was generalized to permit multiple ON CONFLICT clauses and
to allow DO UPDATE resolution without a conflict target in
SQLite version 3\.35\.0 (2021\-03\-12\).
