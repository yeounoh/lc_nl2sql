# 3\. Limitations


UPSERT does not currently work for [virtual tables](vtab.html).



The [conflict resolution algorithm](lang_conflict.html) for the update operation
of the DO UPDATE clause is always ABORT. In other words, the behavior
is as if the DO UPDATE clause were actually written as
"DO UPDATE OR ABORT". If the DO UPDATE clause encounters any
constraint violation, the entire INSERT statement rolls back and
halts. This is true even if the DO UPDATE clause is
contained within an INSERT statement or a trigger that specifies some
other conflict resolution algorithm.
