## 4\.1\. Composite Foreign Key Constraints



 A composite foreign key constraint is one where the child and parent keys
 are both composite keys. For example, consider
 the following database schema:




```
CREATE TABLE album(
  albumartist TEXT,
  albumname TEXT,
  albumcover BINARY,
  PRIMARY KEY(albumartist, albumname)
);

CREATE TABLE song(
  songid     INTEGER,
  songartist TEXT,
  songalbum TEXT,
  songname   TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY(songartist, songalbum) REFERENCES album(albumartist, albumname)
);

```


 In this system, each entry in the song table is required to map to an entry
 in the album table with the same combination of artist and album.

 


 Parent and child keys must have the same cardinality.
 In SQLite, if any of the child key columns (in this case songartist 
 and songalbum) are NULL, then there is no requirement for a corresponding
 row in the parent table.
