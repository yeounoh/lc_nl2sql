## Overview


This document describes the support for SQL foreign key constraints
 introduced in SQLite [version 3\.6\.19](releaselog/3_6_19.html) (2009\-10\-14\). 



The first section introduces the 
 concept of an SQL foreign key by example and defines the terminology 
 used for the remainder of the document. Section 2 describes the steps 
 an application must take in order to enable foreign key constraints in 
 SQLite (it is disabled by default). The next section, section 3, 
 describes the indexes that the user must create in order to use 
 foreign key constraints, and those that should be created in order for
 foreign key constraints to function efficiently. Section 4 describes
 the advanced foreign key related features supported by SQLite and
 section 5 describes the way the [ALTER](lang_altertable.html) and [DROP TABLE](lang_droptable.html) commands are
 enhanced to support foreign key constraints. Finally, section 6 
 enumerates the missing features and limits of the current implementation.



This document does not contain a full description of the syntax used
 to create foreign key constraints in SQLite. This may be found as 
 part of the documentation for the [CREATE TABLE](lang_createtable.html) statement.
