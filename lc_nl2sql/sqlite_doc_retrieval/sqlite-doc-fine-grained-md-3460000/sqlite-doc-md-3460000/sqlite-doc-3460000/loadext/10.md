## 4\.1\. Example Extensions


Many examples of complete and working loadable extensions can be
seen in the SQLite source tree in the
[ext/misc](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc) subdirectory.
Each file in that directory is a separate extension. Documentation
is provided by a header comment on the file.
Here are brief notes on a few of the extensions in
the [ext/misc](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc) subdirectory:



* [carray.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/carray.c) —
Implementation of the [carray table\-valued function](carray.html).
* [compress.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/compress.c) —
Implementation of [application\-defined SQL functions](appfunc.html) compress() and
uncompress() that do zLib compression of text or blob content.
* [json1\.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/json1.c) —
Implementation of [JSON SQL functions](json1.html) and [table\-valued functions](vtab.html#tabfunc2).
This is a larger and more complex extension.
* [memvfs.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/memvfs.c) —
Implementation of a new [VFS](vfs.html) that stores all content in\-memory.
* [rot13\.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/rot13.c) —
Implementation of a [rot13()](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)
SQL function. This is a very simple example of an extension function
and is useful as a template for creating new extensions.
* [series.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/series.c) —
Implementation of the generate\_series [virtual table](vtab.html) and
[table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2). This is a relatively simple example of a
virtual table implementation which can serve as a template for writing
new virtual tables.


Other and more complex extensions can be found in subfolders
under [ext/](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/ext) other than ext/misc/.
