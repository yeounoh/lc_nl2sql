# 1\. Overview


SQLite has the ability to load extensions (including new
[application\-defined SQL functions](appfunc.html),
[collating sequences](datatype3.html#collation), [virtual tables](vtab.html), and [VFSes](vfs.html)) at run\-time.
This feature allows the code for extensions to be developed and
tested separately from the application and then loaded
on an as\-needed basis.


Extensions can also be statically linked with the application.
The code template shown below will work just as well as a statically
linked extension as it does as a run\-time loadable extension except that
you should give the entry point function ("sqlite3\_extension\_init")
a different name to avoid name collisions if your application contains
two or more extensions.
