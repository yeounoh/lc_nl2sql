# 7\. Implementation Details


SQLite implements run\-time extension loading using the
xDlOpen(), xDlError(), xDlSym(), and xDlClose() methods of the
[sqlite3\_vfs](c3ref/vfs.html) object. These methods are implemented using
the dlopen() library on unix (which explains why SQLite commonly
needs to be linked against the "\-ldl" library on unix systems)
and using LoadLibrary() API on Windows. In a custom [VFS](vfs.html) for
unusual systems, these methods can all be omitted, in which case
the run\-time extension loading mechanism will not work (though
you will still be able to statically link the extension code, assuming
the entry pointers are uniquely named).
SQLite can be compiled with
[SQLITE\_OMIT\_LOAD\_EXTENSION](compile.html#omit_load_extension) to omit the extension loading code
from the build.
