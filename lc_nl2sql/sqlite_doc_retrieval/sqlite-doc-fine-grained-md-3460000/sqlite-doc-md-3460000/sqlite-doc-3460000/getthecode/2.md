# 2\. Direct Downloads


Snapshots of official releases of SQLite source code can often
be obtained directly from the [download page](download.html) of the SQLite website.
Even if the specific version desired is not listed on the download page,
the naming conventions are fairly clear and so programmers can often
guess the name of an historical release and download it that way.
