# 4\. Verifying That The Code Is Unmodified



The "manifest" file at the root directory of the source tree
contains either a SHA3\-256 hash or a SHA1 hash for every source file
in the repository. The name of the version of the entire source tree
is just the SHA3\-256 hash of the "manifest" file itself, possibly with
the last line of that file omitted if the last line begins with 
"\# Remove this line". The "manifest.uuid" file should contain
the SHA3\-256 hash of the "manifest" file. If all of the above hash 
comparisons are correct, then you can be confident that your source
tree is authentic and unadulterated. Details on the format of
manifest files are available on the 
[Fossil website](https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/fileformat.wiki#manifest).




The process of checking source code authenticity is automated by the makefile:




```
make verify-source

```


Or on windows:




```
nmake /f Makefile.msc verify-source

```


Using the makefile to verify source integrity is good for detecting
accidental changes to the source tree, but malicious changes could
be hidden by also modifying the makefiles.
