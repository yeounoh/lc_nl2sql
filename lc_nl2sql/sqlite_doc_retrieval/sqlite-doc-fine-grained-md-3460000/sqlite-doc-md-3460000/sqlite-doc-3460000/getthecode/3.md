# 3\. Obtaining Code Directly From the Version Control System


For any historical version of SQLite, the source tree can be obtained
from the [Fossil](https://www.fossil-scm.org/) version control system,
either downloading a tarball or ZIP archive for a specific version, or
by cloning the entire project history.



SQLite sources are maintained on three geographically dispersed
servers:




> <https://www.sqlite.org/src> (Dallas)  
> 
> [https://www2\.sqlite.org/src](https://www2.sqlite.org/src) (Newark)  
> 
> [https://www3\.sqlite.org/src](https://www3.sqlite.org/src) (San Francisco)


The documentation is maintained in separate source repositories on
those same servers:




> <https://www.sqlite.org/docsrc> (Dallas)  
> 
> [https://www2\.sqlite.org/docsrc](https://www2.sqlite.org/docsrc) (Newark)  
> 
> [https://www3\.sqlite.org/docsrc](https://www3.sqlite.org/docsrc) (San Francisco)


To download a specific historical version, first locate the specific
version desired by visiting the timeline page on one of these servers
(for example: <https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline>). If
you know the approximate date of the version you want to download, you
can add a query parameter like "c\=YYYY\-MM\-DD" to the "timeline" URL to
see a timeline centered on that date. For example, to see all the check\-ins
that occurred around August 26, 2013, visit
[https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline?c\=2013\-08\-26](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline?c=2013-08-26).
If you are looking for an official release, visit the
[chronology](chronology.html) page, click on the date to the left of the release
you are looking for, and that will take you immediately to the
check\-in corresponding to the release.



Once you locate a specific version, click on the hyperlink for that
version to see the "Check\-in Information Page".
Then click on either the "Tarball" link or the
"ZIP archive" link to download the complete source tree.
