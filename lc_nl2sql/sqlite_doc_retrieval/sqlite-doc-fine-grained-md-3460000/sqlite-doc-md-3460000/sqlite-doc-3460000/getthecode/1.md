# 1\. Introduction


Most programmers compile SQLite into their applications using
the [amalgamation](amalgamation.html). The [amalgamation](amalgamation.html) is C\-code but it is not
"source code". The [amalgamation](amalgamation.html) is generated from source code
by scripts.



This document describes how to obtain the canonical source code
for SQLite \- the raw source files from which the amalgamation is
built. See the [How To Compile SQLite](howtocompile.html) page for additional information
on what to do with the canonical source code once it is obtained.
