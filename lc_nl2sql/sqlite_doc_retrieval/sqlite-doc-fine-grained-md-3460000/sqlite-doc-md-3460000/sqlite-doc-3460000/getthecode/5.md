# 5\. Cloning The Complete Development History


To clone the entire history of SQLite, first go to the
[https://www.fossil\-scm.org/download.html](https://www.fossil-scm.org/download.html) page and grab a precompiled binary
for the Fossil version control program. Or get the source code on the
same page and compile it yourself.



As of 2017\-03\-12, you must use Fossil version
2\.0 or later for the following instructions to work. 
The SQLite repository started using
artifacts named using SHA3 hashes instead of SHA1 hashes on that date,
and Fossil 2\.0 or later is needed in order to understand the new SHA3
hashes. To find out what version of Fossil you are running, 
type "fossil \-v".


Fossil is a completely stand\-alone
program, so install it simply by putting the "fossil" or "fossil.exe"
executable someplace on your $PATH or %PATH%. After you have Fossil
installed, do this:




```
fossil clone https://www.sqlite.org/src sqlite.fossil

```

The command above
will make a copy of the complete development history of
SQLite into the "sqlite.fossil" file on your computer. Making this copy
takes about a minute and uses about 32 megabytes of transfer. After
making the copy, "open" the repository by typing:




```
fossil open sqlite.fossil

```

This second command will "checkout" the latest check\-in from the SQLite
source tree into your current directory. Subsequently, you can easily switch
to a different version by typing:




```
fossil update VERSION

```

Where VERSION can be a branch name (like "trunk" or "session") to get the
latest check\-in on a specific branch, or VERSION can be a SHA1 hash or a
prefix of a SHA1 hash for a specific check\-in, or VERSION can be a tag
such as "version\-3\.8\.8". Every time you run "fossil update" it will
automatically reach out to the original repository at
https://www.sqlite.org/src to obtain new check\-ins that might have been
made by others since your previous update.
