## SQLite Release 3\.5\.3 On 2007\-11\-27

1. Move website and documentation files out of the source tree into
a [separate CM system](../https://www.sqlite.org/docsrc/).
- Fix a long\-standing bug in INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... statements
where the SELECT is compound.
- Fix a long\-standing bug in RAISE(IGNORE) as used in BEFORE triggers.
- Fixed the operator precedence for the \~ operator.
- On Win32, do not return an error when attempting to delete a file
that does not exist.
- Allow collating sequence names to be quoted.
- Modify the TCL interface to use [sqlite3\_prepare\_v2()](../c3ref/prepare.html).
- Fix multiple bugs that can occur following a malloc() failure.
- [sqlite3\_step()](../c3ref/step.html) returns [SQLITE\_MISUSE](../rescode.html#misuse) instead of crashing when
called with a NULL parameter.
- FTS3 now uses the SQLite memory allocator exclusively. The
FTS3 amalgamation can now be appended to the SQLite amalgamation to
generate a super\-amalgamation containing both.
- The DISTINCT keyword now will sometimes use an INDEX if an
appropriate index is available and the optimizer thinks its use
might be advantageous.



A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.
 A detailed history of every
 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
