## SQLite Release 3\.0\.7 On 2004\-09\-18

1. The BTree module allocates large buffers using malloc() instead of
 off of the stack, in order to play better on machines with limited
 stack space.
2. Fixed naming conflicts so that versions 2\.8 and 3\.0 can be
 linked and used together in the same ANSI\-C source file.
3. New interface: sqlite3\_bind\_parameter\_index()
4. Add support for wildcard parameters of the form: "?nnn"
5. Fix problems found on 64\-bit systems.
6. Removed encode.c file (containing unused routines) from the
 version 3\.0 source tree.
7. The sqlite3\_trace() callbacks occur before each statement
 is executed, not when the statement is compiled.
8. Makefile updates and miscellaneous bug fixes.
