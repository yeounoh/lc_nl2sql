## SQLite Release 3\.7\.2 On 2010\-08\-24

1. Fix an [old and very obscure bug](../https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/5e10420e8d) that can lead to corruption of the
 database [free\-page list](../fileformat2.html#freelist) when [incremental\_vacuum](../pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum) is used.



A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.
 A detailed history of every
 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
