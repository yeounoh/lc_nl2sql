Celebrating the SQLite "Ï€ release"
with a home\-baked pie.
2. Added support for [WITHOUT ROWID virtual tables](../vtab.html#worid).
- Improved the query planner so that the [OR optimization](../optoverview.html#or_opt) can
 be used on [virtual tables](../vtab.html) even if one or more of the disjuncts
 use the [LIKE](../lang_expr.html#like), [GLOB](../lang_expr.html#glob), [REGEXP](../lang_expr.html#regexp), [MATCH](../lang_expr.html#match) operators.
- Added the [CSV virtual table](../csv.html) for reading
 [RFC 4180](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt) formatted comma\-separated
 value files.
- Added the [carray() table\-valued function](../carray.html) extension.
- Enabled [persistent loadable extensions](../loadext.html#persist) using the new
 [SQLITE\_OK\_LOAD\_PERMANENTLY](../rescode.html#ok_load_permanently) return code from the extension
 entry point.
- Added the [SQLITE\_DBSTATUS\_CACHE\_USED\_SHARED](../c3ref/c_dbstatus_options.html#sqlitedbstatuscacheusedshared) option to [sqlite3\_db\_status()](../c3ref/db_status.html).
- Add the
 [vfsstat.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/artifact?ci=trunk&filename=ext/misc/vfsstat.c)
 loadable extension \- a VFS shim that measures I/O
 together with an [eponymous virtual table](../vtab.html#epovtab) that provides access to the measurements.
- Improved algorithm for running queries with both an ORDER BY and a LIMIT where
 only the inner\-most loop naturally generates rows in the correct order.
- Enhancements to [Lemon parser generator](../lemon.html), so that it generates a
 faster parser.
- The [PRAGMA compile\_options](../pragma.html#pragma_compile_options) command now attempts to show the version number
 of the compiler that generated the library.
- Enhance [PRAGMA table\_info](../pragma.html#pragma_table_info) so that it provides information about
 [eponymous virtual tables](../vtab.html#epovtab).
- Added the "win32\-none" VFS, analogous to the "unix\-none" VFS, that works like
 the default "win32" VFS except that it ignores all file locks.
- The query planner uses a full scan of a [partial index](../partialindex.html) instead of a
 full scan of the main table, in cases where that makes sense.
- Allow [table\-valued functions](../vtab.html#tabfunc2) to appear on the right\-hand side of an [IN operator](../lang_expr.html#in_op).
- Created the [dbhash.exe](../dbhash.html) command\-line utility.
- Added two new C\-language interfaces: [sqlite3\_expanded\_sql()](../c3ref/expanded_sql.html) and
 [sqlite3\_trace\_v2()](../c3ref/trace_v2.html). These new interfaces subsume the functions of
 [sqlite3\_trace()](../c3ref/profile.html) and [sqlite3\_profile()](../c3ref/profile.html) which are now deprecated.
- Added the [json\_quote()](../json1.html#jquote) SQL function to [the json1 extension](../json1.html).
- Disable the [authorizer callback](../c3ref/set_authorizer.html) while reparsing the schema.
- Added the [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_UNKNOWN\_SQL\_FUNCTION](../compile.html#enable_unknown_sql_function) compile\-time option and turned that
 option on by default when building the [command\-line shell](../cli.html).
**Bug Fixes:**
- Fix the [ALTER TABLE](../lang_altertable.html) command so that it does not corrupt [descending indexes](../lang_createindex.html#descidx)
 when adding a column to a [legacy file format](../pragma.html#pragma_legacy_file_format) database. Ticket
 [f68bf68513a1c15f](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/f68bf68513a1c15f)- Fix a NULL\-pointer dereference/crash that could occurs when a transitive WHERE
 clause references a non\-existent collating sequence. Ticket
 [e8d439c77685eca6](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/e8d439c77685eca6).
- Improved the cost estimation for an index scan which includes a WHERE clause
 that can be partially or fully evaluated using columns in the index and without
 having to do a table lookup. This fixes a performance regression that occurred
 for some obscure queries following the ORDER BY LIMIT optimization introduced
 in [version 3\.12\.0](../releaselog/3_12_0.html).


**Prior changes from version 3\.14\.1 (2016\-08\-11\):**


1. A performance enhancement to the page\-cache "truncate" operation
 reduces [COMMIT](../lang_transaction.html) time by dozens of milliseconds on systems with a
 large [page cache](../pragma.html#pragma_cache_size).
- Fix to the \-\-rbu option of [sqldiff](../sqldiff.html).


**Changes in this specific patch release, version 3\.14\.2 (2016\-09\-12\):**


1. Improved support for using the STDCALL calling convention in winsqlite3\.dll.
- Fix the [sqlite3\_trace\_v2()](../c3ref/trace_v2.html) interface so that it is disabled if either the
callback or the mask arguments are zero, in accordance with the documentation.
- Fix commenting errors and improve the comments generated on [EXPLAIN](../lang_explain.html) listings
when the [\-DSQLITE\_ENABLE\_EXPLAIN\_COMMENTS](../compile.html#enable_explain_comments) compile\-time option is used.
- Fix the ".read" command in the [command\-line shell](../cli.html) so that it understands
that its input is not interactive.
- Correct affinity computations for a SELECT on the RHS of an IN operator.
Fix for ticket [199df4168c](https://sqlite.org/src/info/199df4168c).
- The ORDER BY LIMIT optimization is not valid unless the inner\-most IN operator
loop is actually used by the query plan. Fix for
ticket [0c4df46116e90f92](https://sqlite.org/src/info/0c4df46116e90f92).
- Fix an internal code generator problem that was causing some [DELETE](../lang_delete.html) operations
to no\-op. Ticket [ef360601](https://sqlite.org/src/info/ef360601)
