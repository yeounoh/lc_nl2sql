## SQLite Release 3\.6\.23\.1 On 2010\-03\-26

1. Fix a bug in the offsets() function of [FTS3](../fts3.html)- Fix a missing "sync" that when omitted could lead to database
 corruption if a power failure or OS crash occurred just as a
 ROLLBACK operation was finishing.



A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.
 A detailed history of every
 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
