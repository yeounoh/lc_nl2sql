## SQLite Release 3\.15\.1 On 2016\-11\-04

**Prior changes from version 3\.15\.0 (2016\-10\-14\):**


1. Added support for [row values](../rowvalue.html).
- Allow [deterministic SQL functions](../deterministic.html) in the WHERE clause of a [partial index](../partialindex.html).
- Added the "[modeof\=*filename*](../uri.html#urimodeof)" URI parameter on the unix VFS
- Added support for [SQLITE\_DBCONFIG\_MAINDBNAME](../c3ref/c_dbconfig_defensive.html#sqlitedbconfigmaindbname).
- Added the ability to [VACUUM](../lang_vacuum.html) an [ATTACH\-ed](../lang_attach.html) database.
- Enhancements to the [command\-line shell](../cli.html):
	1. Add the ".testcase" and ".check" [dot\-commands](../cli.html#dotcmd).
	 - Added the \-\-new option to the ".open" dot\-command, causing
	 any prior content in the database to be purged prior to
	 opening.- Enhance the [fts5vocab](../fts5.html#the_fts5vocab_virtual_table_module) virtual table to handle "ORDER BY term" efficiently.
- Miscellaneous micro\-optimizations reduce CPU usage by more than 7%
 on common workloads. Most optimization in this release has been on the
 front\-end ([sqlite3\_prepare\_v2()](../c3ref/prepare.html)).
**Bug Fixes:**
- The multiply operator now correctly detects 64\-bit integer overflow
 and promotes to floating point in all corner\-cases. Fix for ticket
 [1ec41379c9c1e400](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/1ec41379c9c1e400).
- Correct handling of columns with redundant unique indexes when those
 columns are used on the LHS of an [IN operator](../lang_expr.html#in_op). Fix for ticket
 [0eab1ac759](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/0eab1ac759).
- Skip NULL entries on range queries in [indexes on expressions](../expridx.html).
 Fix for ticket
 [4baa46491212947](https://www.sqlite.org/src/tktview/4baa46491212947).
- Ensure that the [AUTOINCREMENT](../autoinc.html) counters in the sqlite\_sequence
 table are initialized doing "Xfer Optimization" on "INSERT ... SELECT"
 statements. Fix for ticket
 [7b3328086a5c116c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7b3328086a5c116c).
- Make sure the ORDER BY LIMIT optimization
 (from check\-in [559733b09e](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/559733b09e9630fa))
 works with IN operators on INTEGER PRIMARY KEYs. Fix for ticket
 [96c1454c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/96c1454cbfd9509)


**Changes in this specific patch release, version 3\.15\.1 (2016\-11\-04\):**


1. Added [SQLITE\_FCNTL\_WIN32\_GET\_HANDLE](../c3ref/c_fcntl_begin_atomic_write.html#sqlitefcntlwin32gethandle) file control opcode.
- Fix the [VACUUM](../lang_vacuum.html) command so that it spills excess content to disk rather
 than holding everything in memory, and possible causing an out\-of\-memory
 error for larger database files. This fixes an issue introduced by
 version 3\.15\.0\.
- Fix a case (present since 3\.8\.0 \- 2013\-08\-26\)
 where OR\-connected terms in the ON clause of a LEFT JOIN
 might cause incorrect results. Ticket
 [34a579141b2c5ac](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/34a579141b2c5ac).
- Fix a case where the use of [row values](../rowvalue.html) in the ON clause of a LEFT JOIN
 might cause incorrect results. Ticket
 [fef4bb4bd9185ec8f](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/fef4bb4bd9185ec8f).
