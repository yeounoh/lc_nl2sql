## SQLite Release 3\.7\.6\.3 On 2011\-05\-19

1. Fix a problem with [WAL mode](../wal.html) which could cause transactions to
 silently rollback if the [cache\_size](../pragma.html#pragma_cache_size) is set very small (less than 10\)
 and SQLite comes under memory pressure.



A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.
 A detailed history of every
 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
