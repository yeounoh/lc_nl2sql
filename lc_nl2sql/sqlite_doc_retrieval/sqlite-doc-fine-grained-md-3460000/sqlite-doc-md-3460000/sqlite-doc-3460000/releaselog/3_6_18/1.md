## SQLite Release 3\.6\.18 On 2009\-09\-11

1. Versioning of the SQLite source code has transitioned from CVS to
 [Fossil](http://www.fossil-scm.org/).
- Query planner enhancements.
- The [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT2](../compile.html#enable_stat2) compile\-time option causes the [ANALYZE](../lang_analyze.html)
 command to collect a small histogram of each index, to help SQLite better
 select among competing range query indices.
- Recursive triggers can be enabled using the [PRAGMA recursive\_triggers](../pragma.html#pragma_recursive_triggers)
 statement.
- Delete triggers fire when rows are removed due to a
 [REPLACE conflict resolution](../lang_conflict.html). This feature is only
 enabled when recursive triggers are enabled.
- Added the [SQLITE\_OPEN\_SHAREDCACHE](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html) and [SQLITE\_OPEN\_PRIVATECACHE](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html)
 flags for [sqlite3\_open\_v2()](../c3ref/open.html) used to override the global
 [shared cache mode](../sharedcache.html) settings for individual database connections.
- Added improved version identification features:
 C\-Preprocessor macro [SQLITE\_SOURCE\_ID](../c3ref/c_source_id.html),
 C/C\+\+ interface [sqlite3\_sourceid()](../c3ref/libversion.html), and SQL function [sqlite\_source\_id()](../lang_corefunc.html#sqlite_source_id).
- Obscure bug fix on triggers
([\[efc02f9779]](../https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/efc02f9779)).
