## SQLite Release 3\.8\.4\.3 On 2014\-04\-03

**Prior changes from version 3\.8\.4 (2014\-03\-10\):**


1. Code optimization and refactoring for improved performance.
- Add the ".clone" and ".save" commands to the command\-line shell.
- Update the banner on the command\-line shell to alert novice users when they
 are using an ephemeral in\-memory database.
- Fix editline support in the command\-line shell.
- Add support for coverage testing of VDBE programs using the
 [SQLITE\_TESTCTRL\_VDBE\_COVERAGE](../c3ref/c_testctrl_always.html) verb of [sqlite3\_test\_control()](../c3ref/test_control.html).
- Update the \_FILE\_OFFSET\_BITS macro so that builds work again on QNX.
- Change the datatype of SrcList.nSrc from type u8 to type int to work around
 an issue in the C compiler on AIX.
- Get extension loading working on Cygwin.
- Bug fix: Fix the [char()](../lang_corefunc.html#char) SQL function so that it returns an empty string
 rather than an "out of memory" error when called with zero arguments.
- Bug fix: DISTINCT now recognizes that a [zeroblob](../lang_corefunc.html#zeroblob) and a blob of all
 0x00 bytes are the same thing.
 [Ticket \[fccbde530a]](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/fccbde530a)- Bug fix: Compute the correct answer for queries that contain an IS NOT NULL
 term in the WHERE clause and also contain an OR term in the WHERE clause and
 are compiled with [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT4](../compile.html#enable_stat4).
 [Ticket \[4c86b126f2]](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/4c86b126f2)- Bug fix: Make sure "rowid" columns are correctly resolved in joins between
 normal tables and WITHOUT ROWID tables.
 [Ticket \[c34d0557f7]](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/c34d0557f7)- Bug fix: Make sure the same temporary registers are not used in concurrent
 co\-routines used to implement compound SELECT statements containing ORDER
 BY clauses, as such use can lead to incorrect answers.
 [Ticket \[8c63ff0eca]](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/8c63ff0eca)- Bug fix: Ensure that "ORDER BY random()" clauses do not get optimized out.
 [Ticket \[65bdeb9739]](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/65bdeb9739)- Bug fix: Repair a name\-resolution error that can occur in sub\-select statements
 contained within a TRIGGER.
 [Ticket \[4ef7e3cfca]](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/4ef7e3cfca)- Bug fix: Fix column default values expressions of the form
 "DEFAULT(\-(\-9223372036854775808\))" so that they work correctly, initializing
 the column to a floating point value approximately equal to
 \+9223372036854775808\.0\.


**Prior changes from version 3\.8\.4\.1 (2014\-03\-11\):**


1. Work around a C\-preprocessor macro conflict that breaks the build for some
 configurations with Microsoft Visual Studio.
- When computing the cost of the [skip\-scan optimization](../optoverview.html#skipscan), take into account the
 fact that multiple seeks are required.


**Prior changes from version 3\.8\.4\.2 (2014\-03\-26\):**


1. Fix a potential buffer overread that could result when trying to search a
 corrupt database file.


**Changes in this specific patch release, version 3\.8\.4\.3 (2014\-04\-03\):**


1. Add a
 [one\-character fix](https://www.sqlite.org/src/fdiff?sbs=1&v1=7d539cedb1c&v2=ebad891b7494d&smhdr)
 for a problem that might cause incorrect query results on a query that mixes
 DISTINCT, GROUP BY in a subquery, and ORDER BY.
