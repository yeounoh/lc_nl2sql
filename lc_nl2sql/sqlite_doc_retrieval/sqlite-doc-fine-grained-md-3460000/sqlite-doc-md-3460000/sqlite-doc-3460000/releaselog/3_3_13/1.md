## SQLite Release 3\.3\.13 On 2007\-02\-13

1. Add a "fragmentation" measurement in the output of sqlite3\_analyzer.
2. Add the COLLATE operator used to explicitly set the collating sequence
used by an expression. This feature is considered experimental pending
additional testing.
3. Allow up to 64 tables in a join \- the old limit was 32\.
4. Added two new experimental functions:
[randomblob()](../lang_corefunc.html#randomblob) and
[hex()](../lang_corefunc.html#hex).
Their intended use is to facilitate generating
[UUIDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUID).
5. Fix a problem where
[PRAGMA count\_changes](../pragma.html#pragma_count_changes) was
causing incorrect results for updates on tables with triggers
6. Fix a bug in the ORDER BY clause optimizer for joins where the
left\-most table in the join is constrained by a UNIQUE index.
7. Fixed a bug in the "copy" method of the TCL interface.
8. Bug fixes in fts1 and fts2 modules.
