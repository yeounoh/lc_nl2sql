## SQLite Release 3\.7\.0 On 2010\-07\-21

1. Added support for [write\-ahead logging](../wal.html).
- Query planner enhancement \- automatic transient indices are created
 when doing so reduces the estimated query time.
- Query planner enhancement \- the ORDER BY becomes a no\-op if the query
 also contains a GROUP BY clause that forces the correct output order.
- Add the [SQLITE\_DBSTATUS\_CACHE\_USED](../c3ref/c_dbstatus_options.html#sqlitedbstatuscacheused) verb for [sqlite3\_db\_status()](../c3ref/db_status.html).
- The logical database size is now stored in the database header so that
 bytes can be appended to the end of the database file without corrupting
 it and so that SQLite will work correctly on systems that lack support
 for ftruncate().
