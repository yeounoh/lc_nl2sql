## SQLite Release 3\.1\.5 On 2005\-03\-11

1. The ioctl on Mac OS X to control syncing to disk is F\_FULLFSYNC,
 not F\_FULLSYNC. The previous release had it wrong.



A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.
 A detailed history of every
 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
