## SQLite Release 3\.6\.15 On 2009\-06\-15

1. Refactor the internal representation of SQL expressions so that they
 use less memory on embedded platforms.
- Reduce the amount of stack space used
- Fix an 64\-bit alignment bug on HP/UX and Sparc
- The [sqlite3\_create\_function()](../c3ref/create_function.html) family of interfaces now return
 [SQLITE\_MISUSE](../rescode.html#misuse) instead of [SQLITE\_ERROR](../rescode.html#error) when passed invalid
 parameter combinations.
- When new tables are created using CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT ... the
 datatype of the columns is the simplified SQLite datatype (TEXT, INT,
 REAL, NUMERIC, or BLOB) instead of a copy of the original datatype from
 the source table.
- Resolve race conditions when checking for a hot rollback journal.
- The [sqlite3\_shutdown()](../c3ref/initialize.html) interface frees all mutexes under windows.
- Enhanced robustness against corrupt database files
- Continuing improvements to the test suite and fixes to obscure
 bugs and inconsistencies that the test suite improvements are
 uncovering.
