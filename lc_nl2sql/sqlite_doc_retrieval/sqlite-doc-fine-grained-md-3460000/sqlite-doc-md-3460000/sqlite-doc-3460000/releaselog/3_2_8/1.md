## SQLite Release 3\.2\.8 On 2005\-12\-19

1. Fix an obscure bug that can cause database corruption under the
following unusual circumstances: A large INSERT or UPDATE statement which
is part of an even larger transaction fails due to a uniqueness constraint
but the containing transaction commits.



A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.
 A detailed history of every
 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
