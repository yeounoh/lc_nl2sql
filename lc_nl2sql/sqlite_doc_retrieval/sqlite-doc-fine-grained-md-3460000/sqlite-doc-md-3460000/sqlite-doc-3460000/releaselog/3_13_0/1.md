## SQLite Release 3\.13\.0 On 2016\-05\-18

1. Postpone I/O associated with TEMP files for as long as possible, with the hope
 that the I/O can ultimately be avoided completely.
- Merged the [session](../sessionintro.html) extension into trunk.
- Added the ".auth ON\|OFF" command to the [command\-line shell](../cli.html).
- Added the "\-\-indent" option to the ".schema" and ".fullschema" commands of
 the [command\-line shell](../cli.html), to turn on pretty\-printing.
- Added the ".eqp full" option to the [command\-line shell](../cli.html), that does both [EXPLAIN](../lang_explain.html)
 and [EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN](../eqp.html) on each statement that is evaluated.
- Improved unicode filename handling in the [command\-line shell](../cli.html) on Windows.
- Improved resistance against goofy query planner decisions caused by
 incomplete or incorrect modifications to the [sqlite\_stat1](../fileformat2.html#stat1tab)
 table by the application.
- Added the [sqlite3\_db\_config](../c3ref/db_config.html)(db,[SQLITE\_DBCONFIG\_ENABLE\_LOAD\_EXTENSION](../c3ref/c_dbconfig_defensive.html#sqlitedbconfigenableloadextension)) interface
 which allows the [sqlite3\_load\_extension()](../c3ref/load_extension.html) C\-API to be enabled while keeping the
 [load\_extension()](../lang_corefunc.html#load_extension) SQL function disabled for security.
- Change the [temporary directory search algorithm](../tempfiles.html#tempdir) on Unix to allow directories with
 write and execute permission, but without read permission, to serve as temporary
 directories. Apply this same standard to the "." fallback directory.
**Bug Fixes:**
- Fix a problem with the multi\-row one\-pass DELETE optimization that was
 causing it to compute incorrect answers with a self\-referential subquery in
 the WHERE clause. Fix for ticket
 [dc6ebeda9396087](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/dc6ebeda9396087)- Fix a possible segfault with DELETE when table is a [rowid table](../rowidtable.html) with an
 [INTEGER PRIMARY KEY](../lang_createtable.html#rowid) and the WHERE clause contains a OR and
 the table has one or more indexes that are able to trigger the OR optimization,
 but none of the indexes reference any table columns other than the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY.
 Ticket [16c9801ceba49](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/16c9801ceba49).
- When checking for the [WHERE\-clause push\-down optimization](../optoverview.html#pushdown), verify that all terms
 of the compound inner SELECT are non\-aggregate, not just the last term. Fix for ticket
 [f7f8c97e97597](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/f7f8c97e97597).
- Fix a locking race condition in Windows that can occur when two or more processes
 attempt to recover the same [hot journal](../fileformat2.html#hotjrnl) at the same time.
**Hashes:**
- SQLITE\_SOURCE\_ID: "2016\-05\-18 10:57:30 fc49f556e48970561d7ab6a2f24fdd7d9eb81ff2"
- SHA1 for sqlite3\.c: 9b9171b1e6ce7a980e6b714e9c0d9112657ad552

**Bug fixes backported into patch release 3\.12\.2 (2016\-04\-18\):**

- Fix a backwards compatibility problem in version 3\.12\.0 and 3\.12\.1:
 Columns declared as "INTEGER" PRIMARY KEY (with quotes around
 the datatype keyword) were not being recognized as an
 [INTEGER PRIMARY KEY](../lang_createtable.html#rowid), which resulted in an incompatible database file.
 Ticket [7d7525cb01b68](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7d7525cb01b68)- Fix a bug (present since [version 3\.9\.0](../releaselog/3_9_0.html)) that can cause the [DELETE](../lang_delete.html)
 operation to miss rows if [PRAGMA reverse\_unordered\_selects](../pragma.html#pragma_reverse_unordered_selects) is turned on.
 Ticket [a306e56ff68b8fa5](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/a306e56ff68b8fa5)- Fix a bug in the code generator that can cause incorrect results if
 two or more [virtual tables](../vtab.html) are joined and the virtual table used in
 outer loop of the join has an [IN operator](../lang_expr.html#in_op) constraint.
- Correctly interpret negative "PRAGMA cache\_size" values when determining
 the cache size used for sorting large amounts of data.

**Bug fixes backported into patch release 3\.12\.1 (2016\-04\-08\):**

- Fix a boundary condition error introduced by version 3\.12\.0
 that can result in a crash during heavy [SAVEPOINT](../lang_savepoint.html) usage.
 Ticket [7f7f8026eda38](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7f7f8026eda38).
- Fix [views](../lang_createview.html) so that they inherit column datatypes from the
 table that they are defined against, when possible.
- Fix the query planner so that IS and IS NULL operators are able
 to drive an index on a LEFT OUTER JOIN.
