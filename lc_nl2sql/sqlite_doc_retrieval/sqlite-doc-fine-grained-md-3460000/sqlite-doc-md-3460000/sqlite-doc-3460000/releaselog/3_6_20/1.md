1. Optimizer enhancement: [prepared statements](../c3ref/stmt.html) are automatically
re\-compiled when a binding on the RHS of a LIKE operator changes or
when any range constraint changes under [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT2](../compile.html#enable_stat2).

A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
 in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.

 check\-in is available at
 [SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).
