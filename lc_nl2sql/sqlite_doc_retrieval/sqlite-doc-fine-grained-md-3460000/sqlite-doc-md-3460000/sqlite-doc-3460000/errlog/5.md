# 4\. Summary


The use of the error logger callback is highly recommended.
The debugging information that the error logger provides has proven
very useful in tracking down obscure problems that occur with applications
after they get into the field. The error logger callback has also 
proven useful in catching occasional errors that the application
misses because of inconsistent checking of API return codes.
Developers are encouraged to implement an error logger callback early
in the development cycle in order to spot unexpected behavior quickly,
and to leave the error logger callback turned on through deployment.
If the error logger never finds a problem, then no harm is done. 
But failure to set up an appropriate error logger might compromise
diagnostic capabilities later on.
