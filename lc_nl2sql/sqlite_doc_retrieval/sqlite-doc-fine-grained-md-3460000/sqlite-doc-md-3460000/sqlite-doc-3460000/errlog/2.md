# 1\. Setting Up The Error Logging Callback


There can only be a single error logging callback per process.
The error logging callback is registered at start\-time using C\-code
similar to the following:




> ```
> 
> [sqlite3_config](c3ref/config.html)([SQLITE_CONFIG_LOG](c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfiglog), errorLogCallback, pData);
> 
> ```


The error logger callback function might look something like this:



> ```
> 
> void errorLogCallback(void *pArg, int iErrCode, const char *zMsg){
>   fprintf(stderr, "(%d) %s\n", iErrCode, zMsg);
> }
> 
> ```


The example above illustrates the signature of the error logger callback.
However, in an embedded application, one usually does not print
messages on stderr. Instead, one might store the messages in a
preallocated circular buffer where they can be accessed when diagnostic
information is needed during debugging. Or perhaps the messages can be
sent to [Syslog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog). Somehow, the
messages need to be stored where they are accessible to developers,
not displayed to end users.


Do not misunderstand: There is nothing technically wrong with displaying 
the error logger messages to end users. The messages do not contain
sensitive or private information that must be protected from unauthorized
viewing. Rather the messages are technical in nature and are not useful
or meaningful to the typical end user. The messages coming from the
error logger are intended for database geeks. Display them accordingly.
