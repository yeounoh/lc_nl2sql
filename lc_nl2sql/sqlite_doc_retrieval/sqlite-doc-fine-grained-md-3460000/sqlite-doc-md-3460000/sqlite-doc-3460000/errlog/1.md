## Overview


SQLite can be configured to invoke a callback function containing
an error code and a terse error message whenever anomalies occur.
This mechanism is very helpful in tracking obscure problems that
occur rarely and in the field. Application developers are encouraged
to take advantage of the error logging facility of SQLite in their
products, as it is very low CPU and memory cost but can be a
huge aid for debugging.
