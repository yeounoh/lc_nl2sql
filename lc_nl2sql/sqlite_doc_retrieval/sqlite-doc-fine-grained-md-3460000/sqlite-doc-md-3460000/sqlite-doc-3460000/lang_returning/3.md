# 2\. Details



The RETURNING clause is followed by a comma\-separated list of
expressions. These expressions are similar to the expressions following
the SELECT keyword in a [SELECT statement](lang_select.html) in that they
define the values of the columns in the result set. Each expression
defines the value for a single column. Each expression may be
optionally followed by an AS clause that determines the name of
the result column. The special "\*" expression expands into a list
of all [non\-hidden](vtab.html#hiddencol) columns of the table being deleted,
inserted, or updated.




For INSERT and UPDATE statements, references to columns in the table
being modified refer to the value of that column *after* the change
has been applied. For DELETE statements, references to columns mean
the value *before* the delete occurs.




The RETURNING clause only returns rows that are directly modified
by the DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE statement. The RETURNING clause
does not report any additional database changes
caused by [foreign key constraints](foreignkeys.html) or [triggers](lang_createtrigger.html).




A RETURNING clause for an [UPSERT](lang_upsert.html) reports both inserted and
updated rows.
