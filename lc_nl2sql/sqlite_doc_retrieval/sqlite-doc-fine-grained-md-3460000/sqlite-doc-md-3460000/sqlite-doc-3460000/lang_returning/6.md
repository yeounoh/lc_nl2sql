## 2\.3\. ACID Changes



When the previous "*Processing Order*" section says that
"database changes occur during the first invocation of sqlite3\_step()",
that means that the changes are stored in the private page cache of
the database connection that is running the statement. It does
*not* mean that the changes are actually committed. The commit
does not occur until the statement finishes, and maybe not even then
if the statement is part of a larger transaction. Changes to the
database are still atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID).
When the previous section says "changes occur",
this means that internal data structures are adjusted pending a transaction
commit. Some of those changes may or may not spill into the
[write\-ahead log](wal.html), depending on how much pressure there is on the
page cache. If the page cache is not under memory pressure, then
probably nothing will be written to disk until after the transaction
completes, which is after sqlite3\_step() returns SQLITE\_DONE.




In other words, when the previous section says "database changes
occur", that means that the changes occur in the memory of the
specific database connection that is running the statement, *not* that
the changes are written to disk.
