## 1\.1\. Typical Use



The RETURNING clause is designed to provide the application with the
values of columns that are filled in automatically by SQLite. For
example:




```
CREATE TABLE t0(
  a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  b DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  c INTEGER
);
INSERT INTO t0(c) VALUES(random()) RETURNING *;

```


In the INSERT statement above, SQLite computes the values for all
three columns. The RETURNING clause causes SQLite to report the chosen
values back to the application. This saves the application from having
to issue a separate query to figure out exactly what values were inserted.
