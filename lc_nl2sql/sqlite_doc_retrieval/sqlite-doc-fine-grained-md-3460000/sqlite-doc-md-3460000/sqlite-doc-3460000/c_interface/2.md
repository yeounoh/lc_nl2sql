### 1\.0 The Core API


The interface to the SQLite library consists of three core functions,
one opaque data structure, and some constants used as return values.
The core interface is as follows:



> ```
> 
> typedef struct sqlite sqlite;
> #define SQLITE_OK           0   /* Successful result */
> 
> sqlite *sqlite_open(const char *dbname, int mode, char **errmsg);
> 
> void sqlite_close(sqlite *db);
> 
> int sqlite_exec(
>   sqlite *db,
>   char *sql,
>   int (*xCallback)(void*,int,char**,char**),
>   void *pArg,
>   char **errmsg
> );
> 
> ```



The above is all you really need to know in order to use SQLite
in your C or C\+\+ programs. There are other interface functions
available (and described below) but we will begin by describing
the core functions shown above.
