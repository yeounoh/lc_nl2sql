#### 3\.6 Library version string


The SQLite library exports the string constant named
**sqlite\_version** which contains the version number of the
library. The header file contains a macro SQLITE\_VERSION
with the same information. If desired, a program can compare
the SQLITE\_VERSION macro against the **sqlite\_version**
string constant to verify that the version number of the
header file and the library match.
