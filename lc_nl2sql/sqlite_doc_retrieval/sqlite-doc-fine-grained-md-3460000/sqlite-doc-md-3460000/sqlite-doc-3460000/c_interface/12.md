#### 3\.1 The ROWID of the most recent insert


Every row of an SQLite table has a unique integer key. If the
table has a column labeled INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, then that column
serves as the key. If there is no INTEGER PRIMARY KEY column then
the key is a unique integer. The key for a row can be accessed in
a SELECT statement or used in a WHERE or ORDER BY clause using any
of the names "ROWID", "OID", or "\_ROWID\_".


When you do an insert into a table that does not have an INTEGER PRIMARY
KEY column, or if the table does have an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY but the value
for that column is not specified in the VALUES clause of the insert, then
the key is automatically generated. You can find the value of the key
for the most recent INSERT statement using the
**sqlite\_last\_insert\_rowid** API function.
