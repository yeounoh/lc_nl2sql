#### 3\.4 Interrupting an SQLite operation


The **sqlite\_interrupt** function can be called from a
different thread or from a signal handler to cause the current database
operation to exit at its first opportunity. When this happens,
the **sqlite\_exec** routine (or the equivalent) that started
the database operation will return SQLITE\_INTERRUPT.
