#### 3\.5 Testing for a complete SQL statement


The next interface routine to SQLite is a convenience function used
to test whether or not a string forms a complete SQL statement.
If the **sqlite\_complete** function returns true when its input
is a string, then the argument forms a complete SQL statement.
There are no guarantees that the syntax of that statement is correct,
but we at least know the statement is complete. If **sqlite\_complete**
returns false, then more text is required to complete the SQL statement.


For the purpose of the **sqlite\_complete** function, an SQL
statement is complete if it ends in a semicolon.


The **sqlite** command\-line utility uses the **sqlite\_complete**
function to know when it needs to call **sqlite\_exec**. After each
line of input is received, **sqlite** calls **sqlite\_complete**
on all input in its buffer. If **sqlite\_complete** returns true, 
then **sqlite\_exec** is called and the input buffer is reset. If
**sqlite\_complete** returns false, then the prompt is changed to
the continuation prompt and another line of text is read and added to
the input buffer.
