## 1\.1\. The New Version Numbering System (After 2015\-10\-14\)



All SQLite releases starting with 3\.9\.0 use a three\-number
"[semantic version](http://semver.org)" of the form X.Y.Z.
The first number X is only increased when there is a change that
breaks backward compatibility. The
current value for X is 3, and the SQLite developers plan to support
the current SQLite database file format, SQL syntax, and C interface
through [at least the year 2050](lts.html). Hence, one
can expect that all future versions of SQLite for the next several
decades will begin with "3\.".




The second number Y is incremented for any change that breaks forward
compatibility by adding new features.
Most future SQLite releases are expected
to increment the second number Y. The Z is reset to zero whenever Y
is increased.




The third number Z is incremented for releases consisting of only
small changes that implement performance enhancements and/or bug fixes.




The rate of enhancement for SQLite over the previous five years
(2010\-2015\) is approximately 6 increments of Y per year. The
numbering format used by for [SQLITE\_VERSION\_NUMBER](c3ref/c_source_id.html) and
[sqlite3\_libversion\_number()](c3ref/libversion.html) allows versions up to 3\.999\.999, which is
more than enough for the planned end\-of\-support date for SQLite
in 2050\. However, the current tarball naming conventions only
reserve two digits for the Y and so the naming format for downloads
will need to be revised in about 2030\.
