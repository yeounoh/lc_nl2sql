# 1\. Summary


SQLite reads and writes small blobs (for example, thumbnail images)
[35% fasterÂ¹](#approx) than the same blobs
can be read from or written to individual files on disk using
fread() or fwrite().



Furthermore, a single SQLite database holding
10\-kilobyte blobs uses about 20% less disk space than
storing the blobs in individual files.



The performance difference arises (we believe) because when
working from an SQLite database, the open() and close() system calls
are invoked only once, whereas
open() and close() are invoked once for each blob
when using blobs stored in individual files. It appears that the
overhead of calling open() and close() is greater than the overhead
of using the database. The size reduction arises from the fact that
individual files are padded out to the next multiple of the filesystem
block size, whereas the blobs are packed more tightly into an SQLite
database.




The measurements in this article were made during the week of 2017\-06\-05
using a version of SQLite in between 3\.19\.2 and 3\.20\.0\. You may expect
future versions of SQLite to perform even better.
