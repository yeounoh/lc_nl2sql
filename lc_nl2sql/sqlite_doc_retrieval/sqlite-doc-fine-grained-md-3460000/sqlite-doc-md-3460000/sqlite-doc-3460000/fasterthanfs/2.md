## 1\.1\. Caveats




Â¹The 35% figure above is approximate. Actual timings vary
depending on hardware, operating system, and the
details of the experiment, and due to random performance fluctuations
on real\-world hardware. See the text below for more detail.
Try the experiments yourself. Report significant deviations on
the [SQLite forum](support.html#fx).




The 35% figure is based on running tests on every machine
that the author has easily at hand.
Some reviewers of this article report that SQLite has higher 
latency than direct I/O on their systems. We do not yet understand
the difference. We also see indications that SQLite does not
perform as well as direct I/O when experiments are run using
a cold filesystem cache.




So let your take\-away be this: read/write latency for
SQLite is competitive with read/write latency of individual files on
disk. Often SQLite is faster. Sometimes SQLite is almost
as fast. Either way, this article disproves the common
assumption that a relational database must be slower than direct
filesystem I/O.
