The [\-DSQLITE\_DIRECT\_OVERFLOW\_READ](compile.html#direct_overflow_read) compile\-time option causes SQLite
to bypass its page cache when reading content from overflow pages. This
helps database reads of 10K blobs run a little faster, but not all that much
faster. SQLite still holds a speed advantage over direct filesystem reads
without the SQLITE\_DIRECT\_OVERFLOW\_READ compile\-time option.



Other compile\-time options such as using \-O3 instead of \-Os or
using [\-DSQLITE\_THREADSAFE\=0](compile.html#threadsafe) and/or some of the other
[recommended compile\-time options](compile.html#rcmd) might help SQLite to run even faster
relative to direct filesystem reads.



The size of the blobs in the test data affects performance.
The filesystem will generally be faster for larger blobs, since
the overhead of open() and close() is amortized over more bytes of I/O,
whereas the database will be more efficient in both speed and space
as the average blob size decreases.
