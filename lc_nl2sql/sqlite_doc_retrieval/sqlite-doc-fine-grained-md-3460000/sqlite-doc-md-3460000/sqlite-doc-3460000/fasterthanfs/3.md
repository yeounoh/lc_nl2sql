A [2022 study](https://golangexample.com/an-unscientific-benchmark-of-sqlite-vs-the-file-system-btrfs/)
([alternative link on GitHub](https://github.com/chrisdavies/dbench)) found that
SQLite is *roughly* twice as fast at real\-world workloads compared to Btrfs and Ext4 on Linux.




[Jim Gray](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/gray/)
and others studied the read performance of BLOBs
versus file I/O for Microsoft SQL Server and found that reading BLOBs 
out of the 
database was faster for BLOB sizes less than between 250KiB and 1MiB.
([Paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/to-blob-or-not-to-blob-large-object-storage-in-a-database-or-a-filesystem/)).
In that study, the database still stores the filename of the content even
if the content is held in a separate file. So the database is consulted
for every BLOB, even if it is only to extract the filename. In this
article, the key for the BLOB is the filename, so no preliminary database
access is required. Because the database is never used at all when
reading content from individual files in this article, the threshold
at which direct file I/O becomes faster is smaller than it is in Gray's
paper.




The [Internal Versus External BLOBs](intern-v-extern-blob.html) article on this website is an
earlier investigation (circa 2011\) that uses the same approach as the
Jim Gray paper — storing the blob filenames as entries in the
database — but for SQLite instead of SQL Server.
