# 1\. SQLite Always Validates Its Inputs



SQLite should never crash, overflow a buffer, leak memory,
or exhibit any other harmful behavior, even when presented with
maliciously malformed SQL inputs or database files. SQLite should
always detect erroneous inputs and raise an error, not crash or
corrupt memory.
Any malfunction caused by an SQL input or database file
is considered a serious bug and will be promptly addressed when
brought to the attention of the SQLite developers. SQLite is
extensively fuzz\-tested to help ensure that it is resistant
to these kinds of errors.




Nevertheless, bugs happen.
If you are writing an application that sends untrusted SQL inputs
or database files to SQLite, there are additional steps you can take
to help reduce the attack surface and
prevent zero\-day exploits caused by undetected bugs.
