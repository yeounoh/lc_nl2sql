## 2\.4\. Bytecode Is Smaller



The bytecode generated by SQLite is usually smaller than the corresponding
AST coming out of the parser. During initial processing of SQL text
(during the call to [sqlite3\_prepare()](c3ref/prepare.html) and similar) both the AST and the
bytecode exist in memory at the same time, so more memory is used then.
But that is a transient state. The AST
is quickly discarded and its memory recycled, even before the call to
[sqlite3\_prepare()](c3ref/prepare.html) returns, so the resulting [prepared statement](c3ref/stmt.html) ends
up consuming less memory in its bytecode representation than it did as an AST.
This is important because calls to [sqlite3\_prepare()](c3ref/prepare.html) are transient, but
prepared statements are often cached for possible reuse and persist in memory
for a long time.
