## 2\.2\. Bytecode Is Easier To Debug


Bytecode provides a clear separation between front\-end parsing and
analysis and back\-end evaluation of an SQL statement. When problems arise
(incorrect answers and/or poor performance), the developers can examine
the bytecode to quickly determine if the source of the trouble is either the
front\-end analysis or the back\-end data storage section of the product.



In debugging builds of SQLite, the [PRAGMA vdbe\_trace\=ON;](pragma.html#pragma_vdbe_trace) command will
cause a trace of the bytecode execution to appear on the console.
