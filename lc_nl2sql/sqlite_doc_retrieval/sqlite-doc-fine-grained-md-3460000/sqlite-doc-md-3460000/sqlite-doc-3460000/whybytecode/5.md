## 1\.4\. Dataflow Programming


[Dataflow programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming)
is a style of programming in which individual nodes specialize in doing
one small part of the overall computation. Each node receives inputs from 
other nodes and sends its output to other nodes. Thus the nodes form a
directed graph that carry inputs into outputs.




A "dataflow program" is perhaps a better description than "AST" for
the tree of objects that an SQL database engine uses as a prepared statement.
