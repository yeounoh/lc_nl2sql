## 2\.5\. Bytecode Is Faster



I *believe* that a bytecode representation of a prepared statement
runs faster, because fewer decisions need to be made for each step of
the computation. Emphasis on "believe" in the previous sentence
â†’ it is difficult to verify
this claim experimentally since nobody has ever put in the multiple years
of effort necessary to generate equivalent bytecode and tree\-of\-object
representations of a prepared statement to see which one actually runs faster.
We do know that [SQLite is very fast](fasterthanfs.html), but we
do not have good side\-by\-side comparisons with other SQL databases since
the other databases spend a lot of time doing client/server message processing,
and it is difficult to untangle the message round\-trip overhead from the
actual processing time.
