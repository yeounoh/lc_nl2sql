## 3\.1\. Query Planning Decisions Can Be Deferred Until Runtime



When a prepared statement is bytecode, once the bytecode has been generated,
the algorithm is fixed and cannot be subsequently changed without completely
rewriting the bytecode.
This is not the case with a tree\-of\-objects prepared
statement. A tree\-of\-objects is easier to modify on\-the\-fly. The query
plan is mutable and can be tweaked as it is running, based on the progress
of the query. Thus a query can be dynamically self\-tuning.
