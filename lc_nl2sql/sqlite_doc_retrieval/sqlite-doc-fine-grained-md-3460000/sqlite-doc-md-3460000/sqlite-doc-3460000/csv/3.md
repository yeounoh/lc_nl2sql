# 3\. Column Names



The column names of the virtual table are determined primarily by the
**schema\=** argument.
If the **schema\=** argument is omitted, but **header** is true, then
the values found in the first line of the CSV file become the column names.
If the **schema\=** argument is omitted and **header** is false, then
the columns are named "c0", "c1", "c2", and so forth.
