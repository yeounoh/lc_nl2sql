# 1\. History


This document was originally called a "Code of Conduct" and
was created for the purpose of filling in a box on "supplier registration"
forms submitted to the SQLite developers by some clients. However,
we subsequently learned that "Code of Conduct" has a very specific and
almost sacred meaning to some readers, a meaning to which this
document does not conform

Therefore this document was renamed to "Code of Ethics", as
we are encouraged to do by rule 71 in particular and also rules 2, 8, 9, 18, 19,
30, 66, and in the spirit of all the rest.



This document continues to be used for its original purpose \- providing
a reference to fill in the "code of conduct" box on supplier registration
forms.
