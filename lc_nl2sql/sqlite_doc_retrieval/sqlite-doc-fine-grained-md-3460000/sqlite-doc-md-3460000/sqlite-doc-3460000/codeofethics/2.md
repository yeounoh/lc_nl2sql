# 2\. Purpose


The founder of SQLite, and all of the current developers at the time
when this document was composed, have pledged to govern their
interactions with each other, with their clients,
and with the larger SQLite user community in
accordance with the "instruments of good works" from chapter 4 of
[The Rule of St. Benedict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_Saint_Benedict)
(hereafter: "The Rule").
This code of ethics has proven its mettle in thousands of diverse
communities for over 1,500 years, and has served as a baseline for many
civil law codes since the time of Charlemagne.
