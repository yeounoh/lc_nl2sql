## 2\.1\. Scope of Application



No one is required to follow The Rule, to know The Rule, or even
to think that The Rule is a good idea. The Founder of SQLite believes
that anyone who follows The Rule will live a happier and more productive 
life, but individuals are free to dispute or ignore that advice if
they wish.




The founder of SQLite and all
current developers have pledged to follow the spirit of The Rule
to the best of their ability. They
view The Rule as their promise to all SQLite users of how the developers
are expected to behave.
This is a one\-way promise, or covenant.
In other words, the developers are saying: "We will treat you this
way regardless of how you treat us."
