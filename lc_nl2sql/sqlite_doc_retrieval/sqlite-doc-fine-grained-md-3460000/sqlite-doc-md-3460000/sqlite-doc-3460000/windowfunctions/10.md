# 4\. Window Chaining



Window chaining is a shorthand that allows one window to be defined in terms
of another. Specifically, the shorthand allows the new window to implicitly
copy the PARTITION BY and optionally ORDER BY clauses of the base window. For
example, in the following:




```
SELECT group_concat(b, '.') OVER (
  win ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
)
FROM t1
WINDOW win AS (PARTITION BY a ORDER BY c)

```


the window used by the group\_concat() function is equivalent
to "PARTITION BY a ORDER BY c ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
AND CURRENT ROW". In order to use window
chaining, all of the following must be true:



* The new window definition must not include a PARTITION BY clause. The
 PARTITION BY clause, if there is one, must be supplied by the base
 window specification.
* If the base window has an ORDER BY clause, it is copied into the new
 window. In this case the new window must not specify an ORDER BY clause.
 If the base window has no ORDER BY clause, one may be specified as part
 of the new window definition.
* The base window may not specify a frame specification. The frame
 specification can only be given in the new window specification.


The two fragments of SQL below are similar, but not entirely equivalent, as
the latter will fail if the definition of window "win" contains a frame
specification.




```
SELECT group_concat(b, '.') OVER win ...
SELECT group_concat(b, '.') OVER (win) ...

```
