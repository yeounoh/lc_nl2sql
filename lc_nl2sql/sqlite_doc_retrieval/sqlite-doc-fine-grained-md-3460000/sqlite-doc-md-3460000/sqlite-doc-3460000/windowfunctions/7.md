### 2\.2\.3\. The EXCLUDE Clause


 The optional EXCLUDE clause may take any of the following four forms:



* **EXCLUDE NO OTHERS**: This is the default. In this case no
 rows are excluded from the window frame as defined by its starting and ending
 frame boundaries.
* **EXCLUDE CURRENT ROW**: In this case the current row is
 excluded from the window frame. Peers of the current row remain in
 the frame for the GROUPS and RANGE frame types.
* **EXCLUDE GROUP**: In this case the current row and all other
 rows that are peers of the current row are excluded from the frame. When
 processing an EXCLUDE clause, all rows with the same ORDER BY values, or all
 rows in the partition if there is no ORDER BY clause, are considered peers,
 even if the frame type is ROWS.
* **EXCLUDE TIES**: In this case the current row is part of the
 frame, but peers of the current row are excluded.


 The following example demonstrates the effect of the various
forms of the EXCLUDE clause:




```
-- The following SELECT statement returns:
-- 
--   c    | a | b | no_others     | current_row | grp       | ties
--  one   | 1 | A | A.D.G         | D.G         |           | A
--  one   | 4 | D | A.D.G         | A.G         |           | D
--  one   | 7 | G | A.D.G         | A.D         |           | G
--  three | 3 | C | A.D.G.C.F     | A.D.G.F     | A.D.G     | A.D.G.C
--  three | 6 | F | A.D.G.C.F     | A.D.G.C     | A.D.G     | A.D.G.F
--  two   | 2 | B | A.D.G.C.F.B.E | A.D.G.C.F.E | A.D.G.C.F | A.D.G.C.F.B
--  two   | 5 | E | A.D.G.C.F.B.E | A.D.G.C.F.B | A.D.G.C.F | A.D.G.C.F.E
-- 
SELECT c, a, b,
  group_concat(b, '.') OVER (
    ORDER BY c GROUPS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW EXCLUDE NO OTHERS
  ) AS no_others,
  group_concat(b, '.') OVER (
    ORDER BY c GROUPS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW EXCLUDE CURRENT ROW
  ) AS current_row,
  group_concat(b, '.') OVER (
    ORDER BY c GROUPS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW EXCLUDE GROUP
  ) AS grp,
  group_concat(b, '.') OVER (
    ORDER BY c GROUPS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW EXCLUDE TIES
  ) AS ties
FROM t1 ORDER BY c, a;
