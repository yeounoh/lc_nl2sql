# 6\. History


Window function support was first added to SQLite with release
[version 3\.25\.0](releaselog/3_25_0.html) (2018\-09\-15\). The SQLite developers used
the [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) window function
documentation as their primary reference for how window functions
ought to behave. Many test cases have been run against PostgreSQL
to ensure that window functions operate the same way in both
SQLite and PostgreSQL.



In SQLite [version 3\.28\.0](releaselog/3_28_0.html) (2019\-04\-16\),
windows function support was extended to include the EXCLUDE clause,
GROUPS frame types, window chaining, and support for
"\<expr\> PRECEDING" and "\<expr\> FOLLOWING" boundaries
in RANGE frames.
