### 2\.2\.1\. UPDATE FROM in other SQL database engines


SQL Server also supports UPDATE FROM, but in SQL Server the target
table must be included in the FROM clause. In other words, the
target table is named twice in the statement. With SQL Server,
the inventory adjustment statement demonstrated above would be written
like this:




```
UPDATE inventory
   SET quantity = quantity - daily.amt
  FROM inventory, 
       (SELECT sum(quantity) AS amt, itemId FROM sales GROUP BY 2) AS daily
 WHERE inventory.itemId = daily.itemId;

```

MySQL supports the UPDATE FROM idea, but it does so without using
a FROM clause. Instead, the complete join specification is given in between
the UPDATE and SET keywords. The equivalent MySQL statement would be
like this:




```
UPDATE inventory JOIN
       (SELECT sum(quantity) AS amt, itemId FROM sales GROUP BY 2) AS daily
       USING( itemId )
   SET inventory.quantity = inventory.quantity - daily.amt;

```

The MySQL UPDATE statement does not have just one target table like
other systems. Any of the tables that participate in the join can
be modified in the SET clause. The MySQL UPDATE syntax allows you to
update multiple tables at once!
