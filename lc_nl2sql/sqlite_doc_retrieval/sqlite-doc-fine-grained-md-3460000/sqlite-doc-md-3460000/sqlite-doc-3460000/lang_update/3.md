## 2\.1\. Restrictions on UPDATE Statements Within CREATE TRIGGER


The following additional syntax restrictions apply to UPDATE statements that
occur within the body of a [CREATE TRIGGER](lang_createtrigger.html) statement. 



* The table\-name specified as part of an UPDATE 
 statement within
 a trigger body must be unqualified. In other words, the
 *schema\-name***.** prefix on the table name of the UPDATE is
 not allowed within triggers. Unless the table to which the trigger
 is attached is in the TEMP database, the table being updated by the
 trigger program must reside in the same database as it. If the table
 to which the trigger is attached is in the TEMP database, then the
 unqualified name of the table being updated is resolved in the same way
 as it is for a top\-level statement (by searching first the TEMP database,
 then the main database, then any other databases in the order they were
 attached).
* The INDEXED BY and NOT INDEXED clauses are not allowed on UPDATE
 statements within triggers.
* The LIMIT and ORDER BY clauses for UPDATE are unsupported within
 triggers, regardless of the compilation options used to build SQLite.
