## 3\.2\. Query String


A URI filename can optionally be followed by a query string.
The query string consists of text following the first "?"
character but excluding the optional fragment that begins with
"\#". The query string is divided into key/value pairs.
We usually refer to these key/value pairs as "query parameters".
Key/value pairs are separated by a single "\&" character.
The key comes first and is separated from the value by a single
"\=" character.
Both key and value may contain **%HH** escape sequences.



The text of query parameters is appended to the filename argument of
the xOpen method of the [VFS](vfs.html).
Any %HH escape sequences in the query parameters are resolved prior to
being appended to the xOpen filename.
A single zero\-byte separates the xOpen filename argument from the key of
the first query parameters, each key and value, and each subsequent key
from the prior value.
The list of query parameters appended to the xOpen filename
is terminated by a single zero\-length key.
Note that the value of a query parameter can be an empty string.
