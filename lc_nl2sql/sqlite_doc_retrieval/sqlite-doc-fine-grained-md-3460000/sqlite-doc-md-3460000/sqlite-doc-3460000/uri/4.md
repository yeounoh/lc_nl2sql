## 3\.1\. The URI Path


The path component of the URI specifies the disk file that is the
SQLite database to be opened. If the path component is omitted, then
the database is stored in a temporary file that will be automatically
deleted when the database connection closes. If the authority section
is present, then the path is always an absolute pathname. If the
authority section is omitted, then the path is an absolute pathname if it
begins with the "/" character (ASCII code 0x2f) and is a relative
pathname otherwise. On windows, if the absolute path begins with
"**/*X*:/**" where ***X*** is any single ASCII alphabetic
character ("a" through "z" or "A" through "Z") then the "***X:***"
is understood to be the drive letter of the volume containing the file,
not the toplevel directory.



An ordinary filename can usually be converted into an equivalent URI
by the steps shown below. The one exception is that a relative windows
pathname with a drive letter cannot be converted directly into a URI; it must
be changed into an absolute pathname first.


1. Convert all "?" characters into "%3f".
2. Convert all "\#" characters into "%23".
3. On windows only, convert all "\\" characters into "/".
4. Convert all sequences of two or more "/" characters into a
 single "/" character.
5. On windows only, if the filename begins with a drive letter, prepend
 a single "/" character.
6. Prepend the "file:" scheme.
