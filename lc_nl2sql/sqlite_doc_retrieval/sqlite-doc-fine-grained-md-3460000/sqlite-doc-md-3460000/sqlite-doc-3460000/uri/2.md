# 2\. Backwards Compatibility



In order to maintain full backwards compatibility for legacy applications,
the URI filename capability is disabled by default.
URI filenames can be enabled or disabled using the [SQLITE\_USE\_URI\=1](compile.html#use_uri)
or [SQLITE\_USE\_URI\=0](compile.html#use_uri) compile\-time options.
The compile\-time setting for URI filenames can be changed
at start\-time using the [sqlite3\_config](c3ref/config.html)([SQLITE\_CONFIG\_URI](c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfiguri),1\)
or [sqlite3\_config](c3ref/config.html)([SQLITE\_CONFIG\_URI](c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfiguri),0\) configuration calls.
Regardless of the compile\-time or start\-time settings, URI filenames
can be enabled for individual database connections by including the
[SQLITE\_OPEN\_URI](c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html) bit in the set of bits passed as the F parameter
to [sqlite3\_open\_v2(N,P,F,V)](c3ref/open.html).




If URI filenames are recognized when the database connection is originally
opened, then URI filenames will also be recognized on [ATTACH](lang_attach.html) statements.
Similarly, if URI filenames are not recognized when the database connection
is first opened, they will not be recognized by [ATTACH](lang_attach.html).




Since SQLite always interprets any filename that does not begin
with "file:"
as an ordinary filename regardless of the URI setting, and because it is
very unusual to have an actual file begin with "file:",
it is safe for most applications to enable URI processing even if URI
filenames are not currently being used.
