# 1\. URI Filenames In SQLite



Beginning with [version 3\.7\.7](releaselog/3_7_7.html) (2011\-06\-23\),
the SQLite database file argument to the
[sqlite3\_open()](c3ref/open.html), [sqlite3\_open16()](c3ref/open.html), and [sqlite3\_open\_v2()](c3ref/open.html) interfaces
and to the [ATTACH](lang_attach.html) command can be specified
either as an ordinary filename or as a Uniform Resource Identifier or URI.
The advantage of using a URI filename is that query parameters on the URI can
be used to control details of the newly created database connection.
For example, an alternative [VFS](vfs.html) can be specified using a
"vfs\=" query parameter.
Or the database can be opened read\-only by using "mode\=ro" as a query
parameter.
