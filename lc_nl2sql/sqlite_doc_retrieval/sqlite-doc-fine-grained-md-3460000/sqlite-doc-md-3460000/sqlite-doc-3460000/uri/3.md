# 3\. URI Format



According to [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986), a URI consists
of a scheme, an authority, a path, a query string, and a fragment. The
scheme is always required. One of either the authority or the path is also
always required. The query string and fragment are optional.




SQLite uses the "file:" URI syntax to identify database files.
SQLite strives to interpret file: URIs in exactly the same way as
popular web\-browsers such as
[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/),
[Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/),
[Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/),
[Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/products/ie/home), and
[Opera](http://www.opera.com/),
and command\-line programs such as Windows
["cmd start"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/start)
or
["powershell start"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/start-process?view=powershell-7.3),
or the macOS "open" or Linux "xdg\-open" commands.
A succinct summary of the URI parsing rules follows:



* The scheme of the URI must be "file:". Any other scheme
 results in the input being treated as an ordinary filename.
* The authority may be omitted, may be blank, or may be
 "localhost". Any other authority results in an error.
 Exception: If SQLite is compiled with [SQLITE\_ALLOW\_URI\_AUTHORITY](compile.html#allow_uri_authority)
 then any authority value other than "localhost" is passed through to the
 underlying operating system as a UNC filename.
* The path is optional if the authority is present. If the authority
 is omitted then the path is required.
* The query string is optional. If the query string is present, then
 all query parameters are passed through into the xOpen method of
 the underlying [VFS](vfs.html).
* The fragment is optional. If present, it is ignored.


Zero or more escape sequences of the form "**%*HH***"
(where ***H*** represents any hexadecimal digit) can occur
in the path, query string, or fragment.


A filename that is not a well\-formed URI is interpreted as an
ordinary filename.


URIs are processed as UTF8 text.
The filename argument sqlite3\_open16() is converted from UTF16
native byte order into UTF8 prior to processing.
