# 12\. Correlated Subqueries


A [SELECT](lang_select.html) statement used as either a scalar subquery or as the
right\-hand operand of an IN, NOT IN or EXISTS expression may contain
references to columns in the outer query. Such a subquery is known as
a correlated subquery. A correlated subquery is reevaluated each time
its result is required. An uncorrelated subquery is evaluated only once
and the result reused as necessary.
