# 10\. The EXISTS operator


The EXISTS operator always evaluates to one of the integer values 0
and 1\. If executing the SELECT statement specified as the right\-hand
operand of the EXISTS operator would return one or more rows, then the
EXISTS operator evaluates to 1\. If executing the SELECT would return
no rows at all, then the EXISTS operator evaluates to 0\.



The number of columns in each row returned by the SELECT statement
(if any) and the specific values returned have no effect on the results
of the EXISTS operator. In particular, rows containing NULL values are
not handled any differently from rows without NULL values.
