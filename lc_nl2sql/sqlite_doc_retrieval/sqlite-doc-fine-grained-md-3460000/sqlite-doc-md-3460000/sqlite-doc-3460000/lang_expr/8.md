# 8\. The IN and NOT IN operators


The IN and NOT IN operators take an expression on the
left and a list of values or a subquery on the right.
When the right operand of an IN or NOT IN operator is a subquery, the
subquery must have the same number of columns as there are columns in
the [row value](rowvalue.html) of the left operand. The subquery on the
right of an IN or NOT IN operator must be a scalar subquery if the left
expression is not a [row value](rowvalue.html) expression.
If the right operand of an IN or NOT IN operator is a list of values,
each of those values must be scalars and the left expression must also
be a scalar.
The right\-hand side of an IN or NOT IN operator can be a
table *name* or [table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2) *name* in which
case the right\-hand side is understood to be subquery of
the form "(SELECT \* FROM *name*)".
When the right operand is an empty set, the result of IN is false and the
result of NOT IN is true, regardless of the left operand and even if the
left operand is NULL.


The result of an IN or NOT IN operator is determined by the following
matrix:




> | Left operand is NULL | Right operand contains NULL | Right operand is an empty set | Left operand found within right operand | Result of IN operator | Result of NOT IN operator |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | no | no | no | no | false | true |
> | does not matter | no | yes | no | false | true |
> | no | does not matter | no | yes | true | false |
> | no | yes | no | no | NULL | NULL |
> | yes | does not matter | no | does not matter | NULL | NULL |


Note that SQLite allows the parenthesized list of scalar values on
the right\-hand side of an IN or NOT IN operator to be an empty list but
most other SQL database engines and the SQL92 standard require
the list to contain at least one element.
