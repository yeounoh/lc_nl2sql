# 11\. Subquery Expressions


A [SELECT](lang_select.html) statement enclosed in parentheses is a subquery.
All types of SELECT statement, including
aggregate and compound SELECT queries (queries with keywords like
UNION or EXCEPT) are allowed as scalar subqueries.
The value of a subquery expression is the first row of the result
from the enclosed [SELECT](lang_select.html) statement.
The value of a subquery expression is NULL if the enclosed
[SELECT](lang_select.html) statement returns no rows.



A subquery that returns a single column is a scalar subquery and can
be used most anywhere.
A subquery that returns two or more columns is a [row value](rowvalue.html)
subquery and can only be used as an operand of a comparison operator or as
the value in an UPDATE SET clause whose column name list has the same size.
