#### 2\.1\.3 Modifications Of Existing VFSes


 Once a VFS has been registered, it should never be modified. If
 a change in behavior is required, a new VFS should be registered.
 The application could, perhaps, use [sqlite3\_vfs\_find()](c3ref/vfs_find.html) to locate
 the old VFS, make a copy of the old VFS into a new [sqlite3\_vfs](c3ref/vfs.html)
 object, make the desired modifications to the new VFS, unregister
 the old VFS, then register the new VFS in its place. Existing
 database connections would continue to use the old VFS even after
 it is unregistered, but new database connections would use the
 new VFS.
