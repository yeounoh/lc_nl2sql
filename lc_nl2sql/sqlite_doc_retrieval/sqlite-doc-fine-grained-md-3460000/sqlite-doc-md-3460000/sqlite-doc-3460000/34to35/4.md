### 2\.1 The Virtual File System Object


 The new OS interface for SQLite is built around an object named
 [sqlite3\_vfs](c3ref/vfs.html). The "vfs" stands for "Virtual File System".
 The sqlite3\_vfs object is basically a structure containing pointers
 to functions that implement the primitive disk I/O operations that
 SQLite needs to perform in order to read and write databases. 
 In this article, we will often refer to an sqlite3\_vfs objects as a "VFS".




 SQLite is able to use multiple VFSes at the same time. Each
 individual database connection is associated with just one VFS.
 But if you have multiple database connections, each connection
 can be associated with a different VFS.




 There is always a default VFS.
 The legacy interfaces [sqlite3\_open()](c3ref/open.html) and [sqlite3\_open16()](c3ref/open.html) always
 use the default VFS.
 The new interface for creating database connections,
 [sqlite3\_open\_v2()](c3ref/open.html), allows you to specify which VFS you want to
 use by name.
