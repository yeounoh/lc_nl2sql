## 2\.0 The OS Interface Layer


 If your system defines a custom OS interface for SQLite or if you
 were using the undocumented **sqlite3\_os\_switch()**
 interface, then you will need to make modifications in order to
 upgrade to SQLite version 3\.5\.0\. This may seem painful at first
 glance. But as you look more closely, you will probably discover
 that your changes are made smaller and easier to understand and manage
 by the new SQLite interface. It is likely that your changes will
 now also work seamlessly with the SQLite amalgamation. You will
 no longer need to make any changes to the code SQLite source code.
 All of your changes can be effected by application code and you can
 link against a standard, unmodified version of the SQLite amalgamation.
 Furthermore, the OS interface layer, which was formerly undocumented,
 is now an officially support interface for SQLite. So you have
 some assurance that this will be a one\-time change and that your
 new backend will continue to work in future versions of SQLite.
