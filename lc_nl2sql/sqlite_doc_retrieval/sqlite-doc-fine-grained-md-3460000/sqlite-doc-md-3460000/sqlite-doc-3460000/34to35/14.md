## 6\.0 Summary


 The transition from SQLite version 3\.4\.2 to 3\.5\.0 is a major change.
 Every source code file in the SQLite core had to be modified, some
 extensively. And the change introduced some minor incompatibilities
 in the C interface. But we feel that the benefits of the transition
 from 3\.4\.2 to 3\.5\.0 far outweigh the pain of porting. The new
 VFS layer is now well\-defined and stable and should simplify future
 customizations. The VFS layer, and the separable memory allocator
 and mutex subsystems allow a standard SQLite source code amalgamation
 to be used in an embedded project without change, greatly simplifying
 configuration management. And the resulting system is much more
 tolerant of highly threaded designs.
