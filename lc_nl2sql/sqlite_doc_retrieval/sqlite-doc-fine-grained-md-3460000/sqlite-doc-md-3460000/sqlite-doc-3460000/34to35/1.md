# Moving From SQLite 3\.4\.2 to 3\.5\.0


 SQLite version 3\.5\.0 (2007\-09\-04\) introduces a new OS interface layer that
 is incompatible with all prior versions of SQLite. In addition,
 a few existing interfaces have been generalized to work across all
 database connections within a process rather than just all
 connections within a thread. The purpose of this article
 is to describe the changes to 3\.5\.0 in detail so that users
 of prior versions of SQLite can judge what, if any, effort will
 be required to upgrade to newer versions.
