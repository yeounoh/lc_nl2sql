### 2\.1\.1\. The mxFrame field


The 32\-bit unsigned integer at offset 16 (and repeated at offset 64\)
is the number of valid frames in the WAL. Because WAL frame are numbered
starting with 1, mxFrame is also the index of the last valid commit frame
in the WAL. A commit frame is a frame that has a non\-zero "size of database"
value in bytes 4 through 7 of the frame header, and that indicates the end
of a transaction.



When mxFrame field is zero, it indicates that the WAL is empty and that
all content should be obtained directly from the database file.



When mxFrame is equal to [nBackfill](walformat.html#nbackfill), that indicates that all content
in the WAL has been written back into the database.
In that case, all content can be read directly from the database.
Furthermore, the next writer is free to [reset the WAL](fileformat2.html#walreset) if no other
connections hold locks on WAL\_READ\_LOCK(N) for N\>0\.



The mxFrame value is always greater than or equal to both
[nBackfill](walformat.html#nbackfill) and nBackfillAttempted.
