## 1\.2\. The Write\-Ahead\-Log or "\-wal" File


The write\-ahead log or "wal" file is a roll\-forward journal
that records transactions that have been committed but not yet applied
to the main database. Details on the format of the wal file are
describe in the [WAL format](fileformat2.html#walformat) subsection of the main [file format](fileformat2.html)
document. The wal file is named by appending the four characters
"\-wal" to the end of the name of the main database file. Except
on 8\+3 filesystems, such names are not allowed, and in that case
the file suffix is changed to ".WAL". But as 8\+3 filesystems are
increasingly rare, that exceptional case can usually be ignored.
