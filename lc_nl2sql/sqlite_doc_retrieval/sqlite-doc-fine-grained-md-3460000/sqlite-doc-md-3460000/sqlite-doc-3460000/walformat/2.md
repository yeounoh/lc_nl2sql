## 1\.1\. The Main Database File


The format of the main database file is as described in the
[file format](fileformat2.html) document. The [file format version numbers](fileformat2.html#vnums) at offsets
18 and 19 into the main database must both be 2 to indicate that the
database is in WAL mode. The main database may have an arbitrary
name allowed by the underlying filesystem. No special file suffixes
are required, though ".db", ".sqlite", and ".sqlite3" seem to be
popular choices.
