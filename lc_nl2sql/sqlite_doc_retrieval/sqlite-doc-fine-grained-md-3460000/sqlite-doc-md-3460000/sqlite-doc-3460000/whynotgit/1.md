# 1\. Introduction



SQLite does not use the
[Git](https://git-scm.org) version control system.
SQLite uses
[Fossil](https://fossil-scm.org/) instead, which is a
version control system that was specifically designed
and written to support SQLite.




People often wonder why SQLite does not use the
[Git](https://git-scm.org) version control system like everybody
else.
This article attempts to answer that question. Also,
in [section 3](#getthecode),
this article provides hints to Git users
about how they can easily access the SQLite source code.




This article is not a comparison between Fossil
and Git. See
[https://fossil\-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/fossil\-v\-git.wiki](https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki)
for one comparison of the two systems. Other third\-party
comparisons are available as well \- use a search engine to find them.




This article is not advocating that you switch your projects
away from Git. You can use whatever version control system you want.
If you are perfectly happy with Git, then by all means keep using
Git. But, if Git is not working well for you or you are wondering
if it can be improved or if there is something better,
then maybe try to understand the perspectives presented below.
Use the insights thus obtained to find or write a different and
better version control system, or to just make
improvements to Git itself.
