## 3\.2\. Web Access



The [SQLite Fossil Repository](https://sqlite.org/src/timeline) contains links
for downloading a Tarball, ZIP Archive, or [SQLite Archive](sqlar.html) for any
historical version of SQLite. The URLs for these downloads are
simple and can be incorporated easily into automated tools. The format is:




> https://sqlite.org/src/tarball/*VERSION*/sqlite.tar.gz



Simply replace *VERSION* with some description of the version to be
downloaded. The *VERSION* can be a prefix of the cryptographic hash
name of a specific check\-in, or the name of a branch (in which case the
most recent version of the branch is fetched) or a tag for a specific
check\-in like "version\-3\.23\.1":




> https://sqlite.org/src/tarball/version\-3\.23\.1/sqlite.tar.gz


To get the latest release, use "release"
for *VERSION*, like this:




> https://sqlite.org/src/tarball/release/sqlite.tar.gz



To get the latest trunk check\-in, us "trunk" for *VERSION*:




> https://sqlite.org/src/tarball/trunk/sqlite.tar.gz



And so forth.
For ZIP archives and SQLite Archives, simply change the "/tarball/" element
into either "/zip/" or "/sqlar/", and maybe also change the name of the
download file to have a ".zip" or ".sqlar" suffix.
