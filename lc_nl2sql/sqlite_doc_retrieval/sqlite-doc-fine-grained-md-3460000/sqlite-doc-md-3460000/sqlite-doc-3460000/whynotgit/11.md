## 3\.1\. The Official GitHub Mirror



As of 2019\-03\-20, there is now an
[official Git mirror](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite) of the
SQLite sources on GitHub.



The mirror is an incremental export of the
[canonical Fossil repository](https://sqlite.org/src/timeline) for
SQLite. A cron\-job updates the GitHub repository once an hour.
This is a one\-way, read\-only code mirror. No pull requests or
changes are accepted via GitHub. The GitHub repository merely copies
the content from the Fossil repository. All changes are input via
Fossil.




The hashes that identify check\-ins and files on the Git mirror are
different from the hashes in Fossil. There are many reasons for
this, chief among them that Fossil uses a SHA3\-256 hash whereas
Git uses a SHA1 hash. During export, the original Fossil hash for
each check\-in is added as a footer to check\-in comments. To avoid
confusion, always use the original Fossil hash, not the Git hash,
when referring to SQLite check\-ins.
