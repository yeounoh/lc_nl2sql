## 3\.4\. Verifying Source Code Integrity



If you need to verify that the SQLite source code that you have is
authentic and has not been modified in any way (perhaps by an adversary)
that can be done using a few simple command\-line tools. At the root
of the SQLite source tree is a file named "manifest". The manifest
file contains the name of every other file in the source tree together
with either a SHA1 or SHA3\-256 hash for that file. (SHA1 is used for
older files and SHA3\-256 for newer files.) You can write a
script to extract these hashes and verify them against the source code
files. The hash name for the check\-in is just the SHA3\-256 hash of the
"manifest" file itself, possibly with the last line omitted if the
last line begins with "\# Remove this line..."
