## 2\.2\. Git makes it difficult to find successors (descendants)
of a check\-in



Git lets you look backwards in time, but not forwards.
Given some historical check\-in, you can see what came before,
but it is challenging see what came next.




In contrast, Fossil offers helpful displays such as
[https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?df\=major\-release](https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?df=major-release)
to show all check\-ins that are derived from the most
recent major release.

It is not impossible to find the descendants of a check\-in
in Git. It is merely difficult. For example,
there is a
[stackoverflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27960605/find-all-the-direct-descendants-of-a-given-commit#27962018)
showing the command sequence for finding the descendants of a check\-in
in unix:




```
git rev-list --all --parents | grep ".\{40\}.*.*" | awk '{print $1}'


```


But this is not the same thing. The command above gives
a list of descendants without showing the branching structure, which
is important for understanding what happened. And the command only works
if you have a local clone of the repository; finding the descendants of
a check\-in is not something you can do with web interfaces such
as GitHub or GitLab.




This is not really about just finding the descendants of a check\-in
from time to time. The fact that descendants are readily available in
Fossil means that the information pervades the web pages provided by
Fossil. One example: Every Fossil check\-in information page
([example](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/ec7addc87f97bcff)) shows
a small "Context" graph of the immediate predecessor and successors
to that check\-in. This helps the user maintain better situational
awareness, and it provides useful capabilities, such as the ability
to click forward to the next check\-in within a sequence. Another example:
Fossil easily shows the context around a specific check\-in
([example](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline?c=2018-03-16&n=10))
which again helps to promote situational awareness and a deeper
understanding of what is happening in the code. There is a
[whole page of additional examples](https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/webpage-ex.md)
in the [Fossil documentation](https://fossil-scm.org/fossil).




All of the above is theoretically possible with Git, given the right extensions
and tools and using the right commands. But it is not easy to do,
and so it rarely gets done. Consequently, developers have less awareness
of what is happening in the code.
