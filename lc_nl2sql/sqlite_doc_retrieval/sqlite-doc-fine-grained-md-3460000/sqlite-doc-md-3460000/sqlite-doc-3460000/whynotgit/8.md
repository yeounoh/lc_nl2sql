## 2\.5\. Git requires more administrative support



Git is complex software.
One needs an installer of some kind to put Git on a developer
workstation, or to upgrade to a newer version of Git.
Standing up a Git server is non\-trivial, and so most developers
use a third\-party service such as GitHub or GitLab,
and thus introduce additional dependencies.




In contrast, Fossil is a single standalone binary which is
installed by putting it on $PATH. That one binary contains all
the functionality of core Git and also GitHub and/or GitLab. It
manages a community server with wiki, bug tracking, and forums,
provides packaged downloads for consumers, login managements,
and so forth, with no extra software required. Standing up a
community server for Fossil takes minutes. And Fossil is efficient.
A Fossil server will run fine on a $5/month VPS or a Raspberry Pi,
whereas GitLab and similar require beefier hardware.




Less administration means that programmers spend more time working
on the software (SQLite in this case) and less time fussing with
the version control system.
