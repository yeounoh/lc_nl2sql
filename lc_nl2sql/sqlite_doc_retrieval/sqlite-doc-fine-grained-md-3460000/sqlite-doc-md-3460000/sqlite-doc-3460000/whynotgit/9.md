## 2\.6\. Git provides a poor user experience


The following <https://xkcd.com/1597/> cartoon is an
exaggeration, yet hits close to home:

Let's be real. Few people dispute that Git provides
a suboptimal user experience. A lot of
the underlying implementation shows through into the user
interface. The interface is so bad that there is even a
parody site that generates
[fake git man pages](https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/).



Designing software is hard. It takes a lot of focus.
A good version control system should provide the developer with
assistance, not frustration. Git has gotten better in this
regard over the past decade, but it still has a long way to go.
