## 2\.3\. The mental model for Git is needlessly complex



The complexity of Git
distracts attention from the software under development. A user of Git
needs to keep all of the following in mind:


1. The working directory
2. The "index" or staging area
3. The local head
4. The local copy of the remote head
5. The actual remote head



Git has commands (and/or options on commands) for moving and
comparing content between all of these locations.



In contrast,
Fossil users only need to think about their working directory and
the check\-in they are working on. That is 60% less distraction.
Every developer has a finite number of brain\-cycles. Fossil
requires fewer brain\-cycles to operate, thus freeing up
intellectual resources to focus on the software under development.
