## 3\.3\. Fossil Access



Fossil is easy to install and use. Here are the steps for unix.
(Windows is similar.)



1. Download the self\-contained Fossil executable from
[https://fossil\-scm.org/fossil/uv/download.html](https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/uv/download.html) and put the executable
somewhere on your $PATH.
2. mkdir \~/fossils
3. fossil clone https://sqlite.org/src \~/fossils/sqlite.fossil
4. mkdir \~/sqlite; cd \~/sqlite
5. fossil open \~/fossils/sqlite.fossil



At this point you are ready to type "./configure; make"
(or on Windows with MSVC, "nmake /f Makefile.msc").




To change your checkout to a different version of Fossil use
the "update" command:




> fossil update *VERSION*



Use "trunk" for *VERSION* to get the latest trunk version of SQLite.
Or use a prefix of a cryptographic hash name, or the name of some branch
or tag. See
[https://fossil\-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/checkin\_names.wiki](https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/checkin_names.wiki) for more
suggestions on what names can be used for *VERSION*.




Use the "fossil ui" command from within the \~/sqlite checkout to
bring up a local copy of the website.




Additional documentation on Fossil can be found at

Do not be afraid to explore and experiment.
Without a log\-in you won't be able to
push back any changes you make, so you cannot damage the project.
