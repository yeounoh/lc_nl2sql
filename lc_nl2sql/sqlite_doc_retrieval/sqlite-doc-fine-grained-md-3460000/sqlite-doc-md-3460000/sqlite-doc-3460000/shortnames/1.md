# SQLite And 8\+3 Filenames



The default configuration of SQLite assumes the underlying filesystem
supports long filenames.




SQLite does not impose any naming requirements on database files.
SQLite will happily work with a database file that has any filename extension
or with no extension at all.
When auxiliary files are needed for a [rollback journal](lockingv3.html#rollback) or
a [write\-ahead log](wal.html) or for one of the other kinds of
[temporary disk files](tempfiles.html), then the name for the auxiliary file is normally
constructed by appending a suffix onto the end of the database file name.
For example, if the original database is call "app.db" then
the [rollback journal](lockingv3.html#rollback) will be called "app.db\-journal"
and the [write\-ahead log](wal.html) will be called "app.db\-wal".
This approach to auxiliary file naming works great on systems that
support long filenames. But on systems that impose 8\+3 filename
constraints, the auxiliary files do not fit the 8\+3 format even though
the original database file does.
