## Changing Filesystems



The recommended fix for this problem is to select a different
filesystem. These days, there is a huge selection of high\-performance, 
reliable, patent\-free filesystems that support long filenames. 
Where possible, it is recommended that embedded devices use one
of these other filesystems. This will avoid compatibility issues
and the danger of
[database corruption caused by inconsistent use of 8\+3 filenames](shortnames.html#db83corrupt).
