## Database Corruption Warning



If a database file is accessed using 8\+3 naming rather than the default
long filename, then it must be consistently accessed 
using 8\+3 naming by every database
connection every time it is opened, or else there is a risk of database
corruption.
The auxiliary [rollback journal](lockingv3.html#rollback) and [write\-ahead log](wal.html) files are essential
to SQLite for being about to recover from a crash. If an application is
using 8\+3 names and crashes, then the information needed to safely recover
from the crash is stored in files with the ".nal" or
".wal" extension. If the next application to open the database
does not specify the "8\_3\_names\=1" URI parameter, then SQLite
will use the long filenames to try to locate the rollback journal or
write\-ahead log files. It will not find them, since they were saved using
8\+3 names by the application that crashed, and hence the database will not
be properly recovered and will likely go corrupt.




Using a database file with 8\+3 filenames in some cases while in 
other cases using long filenames is equivalent to
[deleting a hot journal](howtocorrupt.html#delhotjrnl).
