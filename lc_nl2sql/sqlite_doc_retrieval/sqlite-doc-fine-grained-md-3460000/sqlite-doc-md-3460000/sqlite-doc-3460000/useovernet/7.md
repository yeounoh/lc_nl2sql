# Performance and Reliability Issues



 From the above diagram and discussion, it is obvious that
 performance (aka "speed") is degraded by insertion
 of a network link into one of the two channels.
 Consideration of relative traffic volumes between
 the API Call channel and the File I/O channel
 reveals that such insertion will have less performance
 impact at the API Call channel.




 Consideration of reliability impact is easier, with a clearer outcome:
 Inserting a network link into the API Call channel may also result
 in call failures at times. But if the Client Application
 has bothered to use SQL/SQLite transactions properly,
 such failures will only cause a transaction to fail
 and be rolled back, without compromising the integrity
 of the data. In contrast, if the network link is
 inserted into the File I/O channel, transactions may fail
 (as for the API Call insertion) but with the additional
 effect that the remote database is corrupted.




 These network unreliability issues can be mitigated,
 completely or to an acceptable degree,
 by using SQLite in rollback mode.
 However, the SQLite library is not tested in across\-a\-network
 scenarios, nor is that reasonably possible.
 Hence, use of a remote database is done **at the user's risk**.
