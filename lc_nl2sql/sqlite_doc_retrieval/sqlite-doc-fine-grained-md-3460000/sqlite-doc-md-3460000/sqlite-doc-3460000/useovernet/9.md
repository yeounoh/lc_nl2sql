# Summary



 Choose the technology that is right for you and your customers.
 If your data lives on a different machine from your application,
 then you should consider a client/server database.
 SQLite is designed for situations where the data and application
 coexist on the same machine.
 SQLite can still be made to work in many remote database
 situations, but a client/server solution will usually work
 better in that scenario.
