# Introduction



 Users of the SQLite library, particularly application developers,
 who want to access a SQLite database
 from different systems connected by a network are often
 tempted to simply open a [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html) by specifying
 a filename which references a database file somewhere within
 a network filesystem. ("remote database" here)
 This "file" is then accessed by means of
 OS API's which permit the illusion of I/O from/to a local file.
 The illusion is good but imperfect in important ways.



 This simple, "remote database" approach is usually not the best way
 to use a single SQLite database from multiple systems,
 (even if it appears to "work"),
 as it often leads to various kinds of trouble and grief.
 Because these problems are inevitable with some usages,
 but not frequent or repeatable,
 it behooves application developers to not rely
 on early testing success to decide
 that their remote database use will work as desired.
