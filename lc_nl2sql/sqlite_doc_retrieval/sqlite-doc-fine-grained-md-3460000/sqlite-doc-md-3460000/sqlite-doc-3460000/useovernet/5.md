## Channel Bandwidth



 The API Call channel operates at processor main memory speeds
 (Giga\-words/second), with data often passed by reference (and so not copied.)
 In contrast, even the fastest File I/O channels are slower.
 They require the data to be copied, usually over a medium
 requiring bit\-serialization. For spinning magnetic media,
 transfers await platter rotation and head movement, then
 are limited by spin velocity.




 When the File I/O channel includes a network connection,
 (in addition to some genuine File I/O at its far end),
 additional slowness is imposed. Even where raw transfer
 rate does not limit bandwidth, the traffic must still be
 packetized and buffered at both ends.
 Additional layers of I/O handlers add scheduling delays.
 However, slowed transfers are the least significant
 issue with network filesystems.
