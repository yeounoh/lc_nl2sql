## Channel Traffic Volume



 The "API Call" channel carries less information
 than the "File I/O" channel.
 API calls to submit queries or specify data modification
 normally require substantially fewer bits to be passed
 back and forth than are transferred to/from
 the database file to store or find the data.
 Query result retrieval will normally require much more file traffic
 than API traffic because the data to be returned is rarely
 to be found without reading unrequested data.
