### 1\.2 Changes To The VFS Layer


 SQLite [version 3\.5\.0](releaselog/3_5_0.html) introduced a [new OS interface layer](34to35.html) that
 provided an abstraction of the underlying operating system.
 This was an important innovation and has proven to be helpful
 in porting and maintaining SQLite.
 However, the developers have discovered some minor flaws in the
 original "virtual file system" design introduced in version 3\.5\.0
 and so SQLite 3\.6\.0 includes some small incompatible changes
 to address these flaws.




> **Key Point:** The incompatible
>  changes in the SQLite operating\-system interface for version 3\.6\.0
>  only affect the rare applications that make use of the 
>  [virtual file system](c3ref/vfs.html) interface or that
>  supply an application\-defined [mutex implementation](c3ref/mutex_alloc.html)
>  or that make use of other obscure compile\-time options. The
>  changes introduced by SQLite version 3\.6\.0 will have zero impact on the
>  vast majority of SQLite applications that use the built\-in interfaces
>  to Unix, Windows, and OS/2 and that use the standard build configuration.
