### 1\.4 Changes To Column Naming Rules


 The column names reported by join subqueries have been modified slightly
 in order to work more like other database engines. Consider the following
 query:




> ```
> 
>   CREATE TABLE t1(a);
>   CREATE TABLE t2(x);
>   SELECT * FROM (SELECT t1.a FROM t1 JOIN t2 ORDER BY t2.x LIMIT 1) ORDER BY 1;
> 
> ```


 In version 3\.5\.9 the query above would return a single column named "t1\.a".
 In version 3\.6\.0 the column name is just "a".




 SQLite has never made any promises about the names of columns in the
 result set of [SELECT](lang_select.html) statement unless the column contains an AS clause.
 So this change to column name is technically not an incompatibility.
 SQLite is merely changing from one undefined behavior to another.
 Nevertheless, many applications depend on the unspecified column naming
 behavior of SQLite and so this change is discussed under the
 incompatible changes subheading.
