### 1\.5 Changes To Compile\-Time Options


 Compile\-time options to SQLite are controlled by C\-preprocessor 
 macros. SQLite version 3\.6\.0 changes the names of some of these
 macros so that all C\-preprocessor macros that are specific to
 SQLite begin with the "SQLITE\_" prefix. This is done to reduce the
 risk of name collisions with other software modules.




> **Key Point:** Changes to compile\-time options have the
>  potential to affect makefiles in projects that do customized builds of
>  SQLite. These changes should have zero impact on application code and for
>  most projects which use a standard, default build of SQLite.
