# Moving From SQLite 3\.5\.9 to 3\.6\.0


 SQLite version 3\.6\.0 (2008\-07\-16\)
 contains many changes. As is the custom with
 the SQLite project, most changes are fully backwards compatible.
 However, a few of the changes in version 3\.6\.0 are incompatible and
 might require modifications to application code and/or makefiles.
 This document is a briefing on the changes in SQLite 3\.6\.0
 with special attention to the incompatible changes.




> **Key Points:**
> * The database file format is unchanged.
> * All incompatibilities are on obscure interfaces and hence should
>  have zero impact on most applications.
