# 1\. Executive Summary


* 200 SQL statements per webpage is excessive for client/server database
engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.
* But with SQLite, 200 or more SQL statement per webpage is not a problem.
* SQLite can also do large and complex queries efficiently, just like
client/server databases. But SQLite can do many smaller queries
efficiently too. Application developers can use whichever technique
works best for the task at hand.
