# 2\. The Perceived Problem



The [Appropriate Uses For SQLite](whentouse.html#website) page says that
dynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL
statements each.
This has provoked criticism from readers. Examples:



* *"200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page"*
* *"For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much."*
* *"\[This is] bad design"*



Such criticism would be well\-founded for a traditional client/server
database engine, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. In
a client/server database, each SQL statement requires a message
round\-trip from the application to the database server and back to
the application. Doing over 200 round\-trip messages, sequentially,
can be a serious performance drag. This is sometimes called the
"N\+1 Query Problem" or the "N\+1 Select Problem" and it is an anti\-pattern.
