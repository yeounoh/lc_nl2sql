# 3\. N\+1 Queries Are Not A Problem With SQLite



SQLite is not client/server, however. The SQLite database runs
in the same process address space as the application. Queries do not
involve message round\-trips, only a function call. The latency
of a single SQL query is far less in SQLite. Hence, using a large number
of queries with SQLite is not the problem.
