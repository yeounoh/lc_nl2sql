## About OpenDocument And OpenDocument Presentation



The OpenDocument file format is used for office applications:
word processors, spreadsheets, and presentations. It was originally
designed for the OpenOffice suite but has since been incorporated into
other desktop application suites. The OpenOffice application has been
forked and renamed a few times. This author's primary use for OpenDocument is 
building slide presentations with either 
[NeoOffice](https://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php) on Mac, or
[LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) on Linux and Windows.


An OpenDocument Presentation or "ODP" file is a
[ZIP archive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_%28file_format%29) containing
XML files describing presentation slides and separate image files for the
various images that are included as part of the presentation.
(OpenDocument word processor and spreadsheet files are similarly
structured but are not considered by this article.) The reader can
easily see the content of an ODP file by using the "zip \-l" command.
For example, the following is the "zip \-l" output from a 49\-slide presentation
about SQLite from the 2014
[SouthEast LinuxFest](http://southeastlinuxfest.org/)
conference:

The ODP ZIP archive contains four different XML files:
content.xml, styles.xml, meta.xml, and settings.xml. Those four files
define the slide layout, text content, and styling. This particular
presentation contains 62 images, ranging from full\-screen pictures to
tiny icons, each stored as a separate file in the Pictures
folder. The "mimetype" file contains a single line of text that says:


> ```
> 
> application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.presentation
> 
> ```


The purpose of the other files and folders is presently 
unknown to the author but is probably not difficult to figure out.
