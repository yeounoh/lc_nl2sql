## Introduction


Suppose the
[OpenDocument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument) file format,
and specifically the "ODP" OpenDocument Presentation format, were
built around SQLite. Benefits would include:
* Smaller documents
* Faster File/Save times
* Faster startup times
* Less memory used
* Document versioning
* A better user experience



Note that this is only a thought experiment.
We are not suggesting that OpenDocument be changed.
Nor is this article a criticism of the current OpenDocument
design. The point of this essay is to suggest ways to improve
future file format designs.
