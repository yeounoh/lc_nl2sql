### 2\.3\.4\. Examples


There are dozens and dozens of SQL function implementations scattered
throughout the SQLite source code that can be used as example applications.
The built\-in SQL functions use the same interface as application\-defined
SQL functions, so built\-in functions can be used as examples too.
Search for "sqlite3\_context" in the SQLite source code to find examples.
