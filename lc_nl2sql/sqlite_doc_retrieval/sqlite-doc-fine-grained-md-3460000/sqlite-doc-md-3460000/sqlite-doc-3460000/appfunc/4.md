## 2\.2\. Multiple Calls To sqlite3\_create\_function() For The Same Function



It is common for an application to invoke sqlite3\_create\_function() multiple
times for the same SQL function. For example, if an SQL function can take
either 2 or 3 arguments, then sqlite3\_create\_function() would be invoked
once for the 2\-argument version and a second time for the 3\-argument version.
The underlying implementation (the callbacks) can be different for both
variants.




An application can also register multiple SQL functions with the same name
and same number of arguments, but a different preferred text encoding.
In that case, SQLite will invoke the function using the callbacks for
the version whose preferred text encoding most closely matches the database
text encoding. In this way, multiple implementations of the same function
can be provided that are optimized for UTF8 or UTF16\.




If multiple calls to sqlite3\_create\_function() specify the same function name,
and the same number of arguments, and the same preferred text encoding, then
the callbacks and other parameters of the second call overwrite the first,
and the destructor callback from the first call (if it exists) is invoked.
