# 1\. Executive Summary


Applications that use SQLite can define custom SQL functions that call
back into application code to compute their results. The custom SQL
function implementations can be embedded in the application code itself,
or can be [loadable extensions](loadext.html).



Application\-defined or custom SQL functions are created using the
[sqlite3\_create\_function()](c3ref/create_function.html) family of interfaces.
Custom SQL functions can be scalar functions, aggregate functions,
or [window functions](windowfunctions.html).
Custom SQL functions can have any number of arguments from 0 up to
[SQLITE\_MAX\_FUNCTION\_ARG](limits.html#max_function_arg).
The [sqlite3\_create\_function()](c3ref/create_function.html) interface specifies callbacks that are
invoked to carry out the processing for the new SQL function.



SQLite also supports custom [table\-valued functions](vtab.html#tabfunc2), but they are
implemented by a different mechanism that is not covered in this document.
