## 1\.2\. Temporary Sorting B\-Trees



 If a SELECT query contains an ORDER BY, GROUP BY or DISTINCT clause, 
 SQLite may need to use a temporary b\-tree structure to sort the output
 rows. Or, it might [use an index](queryplanner.html#sorting). Using an index is 
 almost always much more efficient than performing a sort.
 If a temporary b\-tree is required, a record is added to the EXPLAIN
 QUERY PLAN output with the "detail" field set to a string value of
 the form "USE TEMP B\-TREE FOR xxx", where xxx is one of "ORDER BY",
 "GROUP BY" or "DISTINCT". For example:




```
sqlite> EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT c, d FROM t2 ORDER BY c;
QUERY PLAN
|--SCAN t2
`--USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY

```


 In this case using the temporary b\-tree can be avoided by creating an index
 on t2(c), as follows:




```
sqlite> CREATE INDEX i4 ON t2(c);
sqlite> EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT c, d FROM t2 ORDER BY c; 
QUERY PLAN
`--SCAN t2 USING INDEX i4

```
