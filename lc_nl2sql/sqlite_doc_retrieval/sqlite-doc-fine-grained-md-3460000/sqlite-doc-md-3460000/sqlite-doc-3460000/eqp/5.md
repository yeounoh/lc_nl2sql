## 1\.4\. Compound Queries



 Each component query of a [compound query](lang_select.html#compound) (UNION, UNION ALL, EXCEPT or 
 INTERSECT) is assigned computed separately and is given its own line in
 the EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN output.




```
sqlite> EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT a FROM t1 UNION SELECT c FROM t2;
QUERY PLAN
`--COMPOUND QUERY
   |--LEFT-MOST SUBQUERY
   |  `--SCAN t1 USING COVERING INDEX i1
   `--UNION USING TEMP B-TREE
      `--SCAN t2 USING COVERING INDEX i4

```


 The "USING TEMP B\-TREE" clause in the above output indicates that a 
 temporary b\-tree structure is used to implement the UNION of the results
 of the two sub\-selects. An alternative method of computing a compound
 is to run each subquery as a co\-routine, arrange for their outputs to
 appear in sorted order, and merge the results together. When the query
 planner chooses this latter approach, the EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN output
 looks like this:




```
sqlite> EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT a FROM t1 EXCEPT SELECT d FROM t2 ORDER BY 1;
QUERY PLAN
`--MERGE (EXCEPT)
   |--LEFT
   |  `--SCAN t1 USING COVERING INDEX i1
   `--RIGHT
      |--SCAN t2
      `--USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY

```
