# 3\. Summary And Final Warning



The imposter table mechanism is a power analysis and debugging tool
for SQLite. But as with all sharp tools, it can also be dangerous and
can result in corrupt database files if misused. Do not attempt to
use imposter tables in an application. Imposter tables are intended
for use in the laboratory by experts.
