### 2\.1\.1\. Corrupted Database



A serious problem with the manual imposter table approach described above
is that after adding the new "t2" entry to the "sqlite\_schema" table, the
database file will technically be corrupt. Both the "t1bc" index and the
"t2" table will point to the same b\-tree. This will not cause
any immediate problems, though one should avoid running [VACUUM](lang_vacuum.html).




It is possible to write into the "t2" table, thus changing the content
of the index.
But doing so will get the "t1bc" index out of synchronization with its
parent table "t1". An out\-of\-sync index can result in incorrect query
results.




Since the "t2" imposter table is a form of database corruption, the
manual approach to creating imposter tables is not recommended.
Actually, any use of imposter tables is discouraged for all but
expert developers, but manually created imposter tables are
especially discouraged because they are permanent.
