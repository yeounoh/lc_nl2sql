## 2\.3\. The .imposter Shell Command



As of SQLite 3\.16\.0 (2017\-01\-02\), the [command\-line shell](cli.html) contains
a dot\-command ".imposter" that does all of the work of setting up a
transient imposter table.
Instead of making multiple calls to sqlite3\_test\_control() and figuring
out and invoking a compatible CREATE TABLE statement, a transient
imposter table can be constructed as follows:




```
.imposter t1bc t2

```


Of course, substitute the desired index and imposter table names in
place of the "t1bc" and "t2" shown in the example.
The ".imposter" command reads the schema of the "t1bc" index, uses
that information to construct a compatible CREATE TABLE statement for
the imposter table, then makes all the necessary calls to create the
transient imposter table automatically.
