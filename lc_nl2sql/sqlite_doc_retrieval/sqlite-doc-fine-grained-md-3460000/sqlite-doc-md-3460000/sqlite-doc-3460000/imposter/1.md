# 1\. Introduction



An imposter table is a table that is attached to the same [b\-tree](fileformat2.html#btree)
as an index.
An imposter table allows the content of an index to be queried or
modified as if the index were an ordinary table.




Imposter tables are intended for analysis and debugging only.
This is not a feature that most application developers should understand
or even know about.
Imposter tables are for experts only.




Improper use of imposter tables can cause index corruption, though
any corruption created this way can be fixed by running [REINDEX](lang_reindex.html).
