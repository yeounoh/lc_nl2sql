# 2\. Details



Each table and each index in SQLite is stored in a separate b\-tree
in the database file. Each b\-tree is identified by its root page
number. The root page number for any index or table can be found
by querying the "rootpage" column of the [sqlite\_schema table](schematab.html).
See the [indexing tutorial](queryplanner.html) and the [file format](fileformat2.html) documentation
for further background on this design.




Usually the b\-trees for tables and indexes are slightly different.
A table b\-tree contains a 64\-bit integer key and arbitrary data.
The 64\-bit integer key is the [ROWID](lang_createtable.html#rowid). Index b\-trees contain
an arbitrary binary key and no data. So table b\-trees and index
b\-trees are not directly compatible.




However, the b\-tree for a [WITHOUT ROWID](withoutrowid.html) table is in the same format
as an index b\-tree. Thus, an index b\-tree can be accessed as if it
were a WITHOUT ROWID table.
