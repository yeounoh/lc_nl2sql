# 3\. Multiple VFSes



The standard SQLite source tree contains built\-in VFSes for unix
and windows. Alternative VFSes can be
added at start\-time or run\-time using the
[sqlite3\_vfs\_register()](c3ref/vfs_find.html) interface.




Multiple VFSes can be registered at the same time.
Each VFS has a unique names.
Separate [database connections](c3ref/sqlite3.html) within the same process can be using
different VFSes at the same time. For that matter, if a single
database connection has multiple database files open using
the [ATTACH](lang_attach.html) command, then each attached database might be using a
different VFS.
