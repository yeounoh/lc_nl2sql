## 3\.4\. VFS Shims



From the point of view of the uppers layers of the SQLite stack, each
open database file uses exactly one VFS.
But in practice, a particular VFS might
just be a thin wrapper around another VFS that does the real work.
We call a wrapper VFS a "shim".




A simple example of a shim is the "vfstrace" VFS. This is a VFS
(implemented in the 
[test\_vfstrace.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/doc/trunk/src/test_vfstrace.c)
source file) that writes a message associated with each VFS method call
into a log file, then passes control off to another VFS to do the actual
work.
