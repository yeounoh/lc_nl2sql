## 3\.2\. Standard Windows VFSes



Windows builds also come with multiple built\-in VFSes. The default
Windows VFS is called "win32" and is used in most applications.
Other VFSes that might be found on windows builds include:



1. **win32\-longpath** \- like "win32" except that pathnames can
 be up to 65534 bytes in length, whereas pathnames max out at
 1040 bytes in "win32".
2. **win32\-none** \- all file locking operations are no\-ops.
3. **win32\-longpath\-none** \- combination of "win32\-longpath"
 and "win32\-none" \- long pathnames are supported and all lock
 operations are no\-ops.


As with unix, most of the code for the various Windows VFSes is shared.
