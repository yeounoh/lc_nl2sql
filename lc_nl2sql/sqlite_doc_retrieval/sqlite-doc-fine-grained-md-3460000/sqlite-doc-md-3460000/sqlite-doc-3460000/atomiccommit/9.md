## 3\.6\.  Changing Database Pages In User Space


![](images/ac/commit-5.gif)
After the original page content has been saved in the rollback
journal, the pages can be modified in user memory. Each database
connection has its own private copy of user space, so the changes
that are made in user space are only visible to the database connection
that is making the changes. Other database connections still see
the information in operating system disk cache buffers which have
not yet been changed. And so even though one process is busy
modifying the database, other processes can continue to read their
own copies of the original database content.
