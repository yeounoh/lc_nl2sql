## 3\.1\.  Initial State


![](images/ac/commit-0.gif)
The state of the computer when a database connection is
first opened is shown conceptually by the diagram at the
right.
The area of the diagram on the extreme right (labeled "Disk") represents
information stored on the mass storage device. Each rectangle is
a sector. The blue color represents that the sectors contain
original data.
The middle area is the operating systems disk cache. At the
onset of our example, the cache is cold and this is represented
by leaving the rectangles of the disk cache empty.
The left area of the diagram shows the content of memory for
the process that is using SQLite. The database connection has
just been opened and no information has been read yet, so the
user space is empty.
