## 5\.3\.  Updating Rollback Journal Headers


![](images/ac/multi-2.gif)
The next step is to record the full pathname of the super\-journal file
in the header of every rollback journal. Space to hold the
super\-journal filename was reserved at the beginning of each rollback journal
as the rollback journals were created.


The content of each rollback journal is flushed to disk both before
and after the super\-journal filename is written into the rollback
journal header. It is important to do both of these flushes. Fortunately,
the second flush is usually inexpensive since typically only a single
page of the journal file (the first page) has changed.


This step is analogous to
[step 3\.7](#section_3_7) in the single\-file commit
scenario described above.
