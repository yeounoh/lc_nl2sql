# 1\.  Introduction


An important feature of transactional databases like SQLite
is "atomic commit".
Atomic commit means that either all database changes within a single
transaction occur or none of them occur. With atomic commit, it
is as if many different writes to different sections of the database
file occur instantaneously and simultaneously.
Real hardware serializes writes to mass storage, and writing
a single sector takes a finite amount of time.
So it is impossible to truly write many different sectors of a
database file simultaneously and/or instantaneously.
But the atomic commit logic within
SQLite makes it appear as if the changes for a transaction
are all written instantaneously and simultaneously.


SQLite has the important property that transactions appear
to be atomic even if the transaction is interrupted by an
operating system crash or power failure.


This article describes the techniques used by SQLite to create the
illusion of atomic commit.


The information in this article applies only when SQLite is operating
in "rollback mode", or in other words when SQLite is not
using a [write\-ahead log](wal.html). SQLite still supports atomic commit when
write\-ahead logging is enabled, but it accomplishes atomic commit by
a different mechanism from the one described in this article. See
the [write\-ahead log documentation](wal.html) for additional information on how
SQLite supports atomic commit in that context.
