# 4\.  Rollback


An atomic commit is supposed to happen instantaneously. But the processing
described above clearly takes a finite amount of time.
Suppose the power to the computer were cut
part way through the commit operation described above. In order
to maintain the illusion that the changes were instantaneous, we
have to "rollback" any partial changes and restore the database to
the state it was in prior to the beginning of the transaction.
