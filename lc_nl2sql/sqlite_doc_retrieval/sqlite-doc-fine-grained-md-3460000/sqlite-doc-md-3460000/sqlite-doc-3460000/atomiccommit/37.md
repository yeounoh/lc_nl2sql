## 7\.3\.  Do Not Journal Freelist Pages


When information is deleted from an SQLite database, the pages used
to hold the deleted information are added to a "[freelist](fileformat2.html#freelist)". Subsequent
inserts will draw pages off of this freelist rather than expanding the
database file.


Some freelist pages contain critical data; specifically the locations
of other freelist pages. But most freelist pages contain nothing useful.
These latter freelist pages are called "leaf" pages. We are free to
modify the content of a leaf freelist page in the database without
changing the meaning of the database in any way.


Because the content of leaf freelist pages is unimportant, SQLite
avoids storing leaf freelist page content in the rollback journal
in [step 3\.5](#section_3_5) of the commit process.
If a leaf freelist page is changed and that change does not get rolled back
during a transaction recovery, the database is not harmed by the omission.
Similarly, the content of a new freelist page is never written back
into the database at [step 3\.9](#section_3_9) nor
read from the database at [step 3\.3](#section_3_3).
These optimizations can greatly reduce the amount of I/O that occurs
when making changes to a database file that contains free space.
