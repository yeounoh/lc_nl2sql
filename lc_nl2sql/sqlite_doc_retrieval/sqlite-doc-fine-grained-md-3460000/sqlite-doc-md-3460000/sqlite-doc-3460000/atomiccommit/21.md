## 4\.5\.  Deleting The Hot Journal


![](images/ac/rollback-4.gif)
After all information in the rollback journal has been
played back into the database file (and flushed to disk in case
we encounter yet another power failure), the hot rollback journal
can be deleted.


As in [section 3\.11](#section_3_11), the journal
file might be truncated to zero length or its header might
be overwritten with zeros as an optimization on systems where
deleting a file is expensive. Either way, the journal is no
longer hot after this step.
