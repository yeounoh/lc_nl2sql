## 3\.10\. 0 Flushing Changes To Mass Storage


![](images/ac/commit-9.gif)
Another flush must occur to make sure that all the
database changes are written into nonvolatile storage.
This is a critical step to ensure that the database will
survive a power loss without damage. However, because
of the inherent slowness of writing to disk or flash memory,
this step together with the rollback journal file flush in section
3\.7 above takes up most of the time required to complete a
transaction commit in SQLite.
