# 7\.  Optimizations


Profiling indicates that for most systems and in most circumstances
SQLite spends most of its time doing disk I/O. It follows then that
anything we can do to reduce the amount of disk I/O will likely have a
large positive impact on the performance of SQLite. This section
describes some of the techniques used by SQLite to try to reduce the
amount of disk I/O to a minimum while still preserving atomic commit.
