# 5\.  Multi\-file Commit


SQLite allows a single
[database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html) to talk to
two or more database files simultaneously through the use of
the [ATTACH DATABASE](lang_attach.html) command.
When multiple database files are modified within a single
transaction, all files are updated atomically.
In other words, either all of the database files are updated or
else none of them are.
Achieving an atomic commit across multiple database files is
more complex that doing so for a single file. This section
describes how SQLite works that bit of magic.
