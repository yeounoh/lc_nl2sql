## 9\.4\.  Garbage Written Into Files


SQLite database files are ordinary disk files that can be
opened and written by ordinary user processes. A rogue process
can open an SQLite database and fill it with corrupt data.
Corrupt data might also be introduced into an SQLite database
by bugs in the operating system or disk controller; especially
bugs triggered by a power failure. There is nothing SQLite can
do to defend against these kinds of problems.
