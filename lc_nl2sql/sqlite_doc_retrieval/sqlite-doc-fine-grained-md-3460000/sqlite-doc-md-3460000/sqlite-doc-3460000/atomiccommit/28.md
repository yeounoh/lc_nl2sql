## 5\.5\.  Delete The Super\-Journal File


![](images/ac/multi-4.gif)
The next step is to delete the super\-journal file.
This is the point where the multi\-file transaction commits.
This step corresponds to
[step 3\.11](#section_3_11) in the single\-file
commit scenario where the rollback journal is deleted.


If a power failure or operating system crash occurs at this
point, the transaction will not rollback when the system reboots
even though there are rollback journals present. The
difference is the super\-journal pathname in the header of the
rollback journal. Upon restart, SQLite only considers a journal
to be hot and will only playback the journal if there is no
super\-journal filename in the header (which is the case for
a single\-file commit) or if the super\-journal file still
exists on disk.
