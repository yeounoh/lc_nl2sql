# 10\.  Future Directions And Conclusion


Every now and then someone discovers a new failure mode for
the atomic commit mechanism in SQLite and the developers have to
put in a patch. This is happening less and less and the
failure modes are becoming more and more obscure. But it would
still be foolish to suppose that the atomic commit logic of
SQLite is entirely bug\-free. The developers are committed to fixing
these bugs as quickly as they might be found.



The developers are also on the lookout for new ways to
optimize the commit mechanism. The current VFS implementations
for Unix (Linux and Mac OS X) and Windows make pessimistic assumptions about
the behavior of those systems. After consultation with experts
on how these systems work, we might be able to relax some of the
assumptions on these systems and allow them to run faster. In
particular, we suspect that most modern filesystems exhibit the
safe append property and that many of them might support atomic
sector writes. But until this is known for certain, SQLite will
take the conservative approach and assume the worst.
