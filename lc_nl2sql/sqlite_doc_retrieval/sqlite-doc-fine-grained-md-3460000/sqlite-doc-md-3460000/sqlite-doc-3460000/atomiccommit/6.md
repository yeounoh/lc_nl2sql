## 3\.3\.  Reading Information Out Of The Database


![](images/ac/commit-2.gif)
After the shared lock is acquired, we can begin reading
information from the database file. In this scenario, we
are assuming a cold cache, so information must first be
read from mass storage into the operating system cache then
transferred from operating system cache into user space.
On subsequent reads, some or all of the information might
already be found in the operating system cache and so only
the transfer to user space would be required.


Usually only a subset of the pages in the database file
are read. In this example we are showing three
pages out of eight being read. In a typical application, a
database will have thousands of pages and a query will normally
only touch a small percentage of those pages.
