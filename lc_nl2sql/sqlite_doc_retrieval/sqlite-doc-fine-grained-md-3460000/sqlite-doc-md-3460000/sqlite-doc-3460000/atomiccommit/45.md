## 9\.3\.  Partial File Deletions


SQLite assumes that file deletion is an atomic operation from the
point of view of a user process. If power fails in the middle of
a file deletion, then after power is restored SQLite expects to see
either the entire file with all of its original data intact, or it
expects not to find the file at all. Transactions may not be atomic
on systems that do not work this way.
