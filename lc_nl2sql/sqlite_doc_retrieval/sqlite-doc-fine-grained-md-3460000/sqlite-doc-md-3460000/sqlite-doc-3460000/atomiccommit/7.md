## 3\.4\.  Obtaining A Reserved Lock


![](images/ac/commit-3.gif)
Before making changes to the database, SQLite first
obtains a "reserved" lock on the database file. A reserved
lock is similar to a shared lock in that both a reserved lock
and shared lock allow other processes to read from the database
file. A single reserve lock can coexist with multiple shared
locks from other processes. However, there can only be a
single reserved lock on the database file. Hence only a
single process can be attempting to write to the database
at one time.


The idea behind a reserved lock is that it signals that
a process intends to modify the database file in the near
future but has not yet started to make the modifications.
And because the modifications have not yet started, other
processes can continue to read from the database. However,
no other process should also begin trying to write to the
database.
