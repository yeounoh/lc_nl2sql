# 1\. Introduction


A [virtual table](vtab.html) is an object that presents an SQL table
interface but which is not stored in the database file, at least
not directly. The virtual table mechanism is a feature
of SQLite that allows SQLite to access and manipulate resources
other than bits in the database file using the powerful SQL
query language.




The table below lists a few of the virtual tables implementations
available for SQLite. Developers can deploy these virtual tables
in their own applications, or use the implementations shown below
as templates for writing their own virtual tables.




The list below is not exhaustive.
Other virtual table implementation exist in the SQLite source tree
and elsewhere.
The list below tries to capture the more interesting virtual table
implementations.
