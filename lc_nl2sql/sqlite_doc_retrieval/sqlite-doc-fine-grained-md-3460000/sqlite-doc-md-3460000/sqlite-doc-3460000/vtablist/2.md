# 2\. Virtual Tables




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[approximate\_match](https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/amatch.c)** | A demonstration of how to use a virtual table to implement  approximate string matching. |
| **[bytecode](bytecodevtab.html)** | A [table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2) that shows the bytecodes of a prepared  statement. |
| **[carray](carray.html)** | A [table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2) that allows a C\-language array of integers,  doubles, or strings to be used as table in a query. |
| **[closure](https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/closure.c)** | Compute the transitive closure of a set. |
| **[completion](completion.html)** | Suggests completions for partially\-entered words during interactive  SQL input. Used by the [CLI](cli.html) to help implement tab\-completion. |
| **[csv](csv.html)** | A virtual table that represents a comma\-separated\-value or CSV file  ([RFC 4180](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt)) as a read\-only  table so that it can be used as part of a larger query. |
| **[dbstat](dbstat.html)** | Provides information about the purpose and use of each page in a  database file. Used in the implementation of the  [sqlite3\_analyzer](sqlanalyze.html) utility program. |
| **[files\_of\_checkin](https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/file/src/foci.c)** | Provides information about all files in a single check\-in in the  [Fossil version control system](https://fossil-scm.org/). This  virtual table is not part of the SQLite project but is included because  it provides an example of how to use virtual tables and because it is  used to help version control the SQLite sources. |
| **[fsdir](https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/fileio.c)** | A [table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2) returning one row for each file in a  selected file hierarchy of the host computer. Used by the  [CLI](cli.html) to help implement the [.archive command](cli.html#sqlar). |
| **[FTS3](fts3.html)** | A high\-performance full\-text search index. |
| **[FTS5](fts5.html)** | A higher\-performance full\-text search index |
| **[generate\_series](series.html)** | A [table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2) returning a sequence of  integers, modeled after the table\-valued function by the same  name in PostgreSQL. |
| **[json\_each](json1.html#jeach)** | A [table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2) for decomposing a JSON string. |
| **[json\_tree](json1.html#jtree)** | A [table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2) for decomposing a JSON string. |
| **[OsQuery](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)** | Hundreds of virtual tables that publish various aspects of the  host computer, such as the process table, user lists, active network  connections, and so forth.  OsQuery is a separate project, started by Facebook, hosted on  [GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/osquery), and intended for  security analysis and intrusion detection  OsQuery is not a part of the SQLite project, but is included in this  list because it demonstrates how the SQL language and the  SQLite virtual table mechanism  can be leveraged to provide elegant solutions  to important real\-world problems. |
| **[pragma](pragma.html#pragfunc)** | Built\-in [table\-valued functions](vtab.html#tabfunc2) that return the results of [PRAGMA](pragma.html#syntax)  statements for use within ordinary SQL queries. |
| **[RTree](rtree.html)** | An implementation of the Guttmann R\*Tree spatial index idea. |
| **[spellfix1](spellfix1.html)** | A virtual table that implements a spelling correction engine. |
| **[sqlite\_btreeinfo](https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/btreeinfo.c)** | This experimental [table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2) provides information about  a single [B\-tree](fileformat2.html#btree) in a database file, such as the depth, and estimated  number of pages and number of entries, and so forth. |
| **[sqlite\_dbpage](dbpage.html)** | Key/value store for the raw database file content. The key is the  page number and the value is binary page content. |
| **[sqlite\_memstat](memstat.html)** | Provides SQL access to the [sqlite3\_status64()](c3ref/status.html) and  [sqlite3\_db\_status()](c3ref/db_status.html) interfaces. |
| **[sqlite\_stmt](stmt.html)** | A [table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2) containing one row for each  [prepared statement](c3ref/stmt.html) associated with an open [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html). |
| **[swarmvtab](swarmvtab.html#overview)** | An experimental module providing on\-demand read\-only access to  multiple tables spread across multiple databases, via a single  virtual table abstraction. |
| **[tables\_used](bytecodevtab.html)** | A [table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2) that shows the tables and indexes that  are accessed by a prepared statement. |
| **[tclvar](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/test_tclvar.c)** | Represents the global variables of a   [TCL Interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl) as an SQL  table. Used as part of the SQLite test suite. |
| **[templatevtab](https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/templatevtab.c)** | A template virtual table implementation useful as a starting point  for developers who want to write their own virtual tables |
| **[unionvtab](unionvtab.html)** | An experimental module providing on\-demand read\-only access to  multiple tables spread across multiple databases, via a single  virtual table abstraction. |
| **[vfsstat](https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/vfsstat.c)** | A [table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2) which, in combination with a  co\-packaged [VFS shim](vfs.html#shim) provides information on the number of  system calls performed by SQLite. |
| **[vtablog](https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/vtablog.c)** | A virtual table that prints diagnostic information  on stdout when its key methods are invoked. Intended for  interactive analysis and debugging of virtual table interfaces. |
| **[wholenumber](https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/wholenumber.c)** | A virtual table returns all integers between 1 and 4294967295\. |
| **[zipfile](zipfile.html)** | Represent a  [ZIP Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format))  as an SQL table. Works for both reading and writing. Used by  the [CLI](cli.html) to implement the ability to read and write ZIP Archives. |
