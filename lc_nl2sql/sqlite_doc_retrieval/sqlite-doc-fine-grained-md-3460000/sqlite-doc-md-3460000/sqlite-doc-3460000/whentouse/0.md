[3\. Checklist For Choosing The Right Database Engine](#checklist_for_choosing_the_right_database_engine)





SQLite is not directly comparable to client/server SQL database engines such
as MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server since SQLite is trying to
solve a different problem.




Client/server SQL database engines strive to implement a shared repository
of enterprise data. They emphasize scalability, concurrency, centralization,
and control.
SQLite strives to provide local data storage for
individual applications and devices. SQLite emphasizes economy,
efficiency, reliability, independence, and simplicity.




SQLite does not compete with client/server databases.
SQLite competes with [fopen()](http://man.he.net/man3/fopen).
