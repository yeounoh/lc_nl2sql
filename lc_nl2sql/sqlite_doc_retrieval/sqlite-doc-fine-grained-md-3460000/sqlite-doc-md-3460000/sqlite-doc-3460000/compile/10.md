# 10\.  Analysis and Debugging Options



**SQLITE\_DEBUG**


> The SQLite source code contains literally thousands of assert() statements
>  used to verify internal assumptions and subroutine preconditions and
>  postconditions. These assert() statements are normally turned off
>  (they generate no code) since turning them on makes SQLite run approximately
>  three times slower. But for testing and analysis, it is useful to turn
>  the assert() statements on. The SQLITE\_DEBUG compile\-time option does this.
>  SQLITE\_DEBUG also enables some other debugging features, such as
>  special [PRAGMA](pragma.html#syntax) statements that turn on tracing and listing features
>  used for troubleshooting and analysis of the [VDBE](opcode.html) and code generator.


**SQLITE\_MEMDEBUG**


> The SQLITE\_MEMDEBUG option causes an instrumented
>  [debugging memory allocator](malloc.html#memdebug)
>  to be used as the default memory allocator within SQLite. The
>  instrumented memory allocator checks for misuse of dynamically allocated
>  memory. Examples of misuse include using memory after it is freed,
>  writing off the ends of a memory allocation, freeing memory not previously
>  obtained from the memory allocator, or failing to initialize newly
>  allocated memory.
