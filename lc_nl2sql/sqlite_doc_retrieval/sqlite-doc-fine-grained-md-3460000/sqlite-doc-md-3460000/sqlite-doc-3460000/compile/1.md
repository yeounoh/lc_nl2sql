# 1\. Overview



For most purposes, SQLite can be built just fine using the default
compilation options. However, if required, the compile\-time options
documented below can be used to
[omit SQLite features](#omitfeatures) (resulting in
a [smaller compiled library size](footprint.html)) or to change the
[default values](#defaults) of some parameters.




Every effort has been made to ensure that the various combinations
of compilation options work harmoniously and produce a working library.
Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended that the SQLite test\-suite
be executed to check for errors before using an SQLite library built
with non\-standard compilation options.
