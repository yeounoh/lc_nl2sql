## 3\.8\. NOT NULL constraints


A NOT NULL constraint may only be attached to a column definition,
 not specified as a table constraint. Not surprisingly, a NOT NULL
 constraint dictates that the associated column may not contain a NULL value.
 Attempting to set the column value to NULL when inserting a new row or
 updating an existing one causes a constraint violation. NOT NULL
 constraints are not verified during queries, so a query of a column might
 produce a NULL value even though the column is marked as NOT NULL, if the
 database file is corrupt.
