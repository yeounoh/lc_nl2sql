# 3\. Column Definitions


Unless it is a CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT statement, a CREATE TABLE includes
one or more [column definitions](syntax/column-def.html), optionally followed by a list of
[table constraints](syntax/table-constraint.html). Each column definition consists of the
name of the column, optionally followed by the declared type of the column,
then one or more optional [column constraints](syntax/column-constraint.html). Included in
the definition of "column constraints" for the purposes of the previous
statement are the COLLATE and DEFAULT clauses, even though these are not really
constraints in the sense that they do not restrict the data that the table may
contain. The other constraints \- NOT NULL, CHECK, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY and
FOREIGN KEY constraints \- impose restrictions on the table data.



The number of columns in a table is limited by the [SQLITE\_MAX\_COLUMN](limits.html#max_column)
compile\-time parameter. A single row of a table cannot store more than
[SQLITE\_MAX\_LENGTH](limits.html#max_length) bytes of data. Both of these limits can be lowered at
runtime using the [sqlite3\_limit()](c3ref/limit.html) C/C\+\+ interface.
