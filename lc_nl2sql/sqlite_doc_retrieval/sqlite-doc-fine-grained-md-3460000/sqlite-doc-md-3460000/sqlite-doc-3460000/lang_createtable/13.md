# 4\. Constraint enforcement


Constraints are checked during [INSERT](lang_insert.html) and [UPDATE](lang_update.html) and by
[PRAGMA integrity\_check](pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check) and [PRAGMA quick\_check](pragma.html#pragma_quick_check) and sometimes
by [ALTER TABLE](lang_altertable.html). Queries and [DELETE](lang_delete.html)
statements do not normally verify constraints.
Hence, if a database file has been corrupted (perhaps by an external
program making direct changes to the database file without going through 
the SQLite library) a query might return data that violates a constraint.
For example:




```
CREATE TABLE t1(x INT CHECK( x>3 ));
/* Insert a row with X less than 3 by directly writing into the
** database file using an external program */
PRAGMA integrity_check;  -- Reports row with x less than 3 as corrupt
INSERT INTO t1(x) VALUES(2);  -- Fails with SQLITE_CORRUPT
SELECT x FROM t1;  -- Returns an integer less than 3 in spite of the CHECK constraint

```

Enforcement of CHECK constraints can be temporarily disabled using
the [PRAGMA ignore\_check\_constraints\=ON;](pragma.html#pragma_ignore_check_constraints) statement.
