## 3\.6\. UNIQUE constraints


A UNIQUE constraint is similar to a PRIMARY KEY constraint, except
 that a single table may have any number of UNIQUE constraints. For each
 UNIQUE constraint on the table, each row must contain a unique combination
 of values in the columns identified by the UNIQUE constraint. 
 For the purposes of UNIQUE constraints, NULL values
 are considered distinct from all other values, including other NULLs.
 As with PRIMARY KEYs, a UNIQUE [table\-constraint](syntax/table-constraint.html) clause must contain
 only column names â€” the use of 
 expressions in an [indexed\-column](syntax/indexed-column.html) of a UNIQUE [table\-constraint](syntax/table-constraint.html)
 is not supported.
 



In most cases, UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY
 constraints are implemented by creating a unique index in the database.
 (The exceptions are [INTEGER PRIMARY KEY](lang_createtable.html#rowid) and PRIMARY KEYs on 
 [WITHOUT ROWID](withoutrowid.html) tables.)
 Hence, the following schemas are logically equivalent:

 

1. CREATE TABLE t1(a, b UNIQUE);
2. CREATE TABLE t1(a, b PRIMARY KEY);
3. CREATE TABLE t1(a, b);  

 CREATE UNIQUE INDEX t1b ON t1(b);
