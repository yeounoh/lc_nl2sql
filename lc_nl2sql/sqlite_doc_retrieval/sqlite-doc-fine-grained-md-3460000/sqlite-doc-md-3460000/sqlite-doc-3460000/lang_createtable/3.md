## 2\.1\. CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT Statements


A "CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT" statement creates and populates a database
table based on the results of a SELECT statement. The table has the same
number of columns as the SELECT statement returns. The name of
each column is the same as the name of the corresponding column in the result
set of the SELECT statement. The declared type of each column is determined
by the [expression affinity](datatype3.html#expraff) of the corresponding expression in the result set
of the SELECT statement, as follows:





| Expression Affinity | Column Declared Type |
| --- | --- |
| TEXT | "TEXT" |
| NUMERIC | "NUM" |
| INTEGER | "INT" |
| REAL | "REAL" |
| BLOB (a.k.a "NONE") | "" (empty string) |


A table created using CREATE TABLE AS has no PRIMARY KEY and no
constraints of any kind. The default value of each column is NULL. The default
collation sequence for each column of the new table is BINARY.



Tables created using CREATE TABLE AS are initially populated with the
rows of data returned by the SELECT statement. Rows are assigned contiguously
ascending [rowid](lang_createtable.html#rowid) values, starting with 1, in the [order](lang_select.html#orderby) that they
are returned by the SELECT statement.
