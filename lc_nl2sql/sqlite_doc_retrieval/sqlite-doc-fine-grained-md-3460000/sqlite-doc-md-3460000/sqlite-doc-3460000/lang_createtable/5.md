## 3\.1\. Column Data Types


Unlike most SQL databases, SQLite does not restrict the type of data that
may be inserted into a column based on the columns declared type. Instead,
SQLite uses [dynamic typing](datatype3.html). The declared type of a column is used to
determine the [affinity](datatype3.html#affinity) of the column only.
