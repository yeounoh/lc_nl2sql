## 3\.7\. CHECK constraints


A CHECK constraint may be attached to a column definition or
 specified as a table constraint. In practice it makes no difference. Each
 time a new row is inserted into the table or an existing row is updated,
 the expression associated with each CHECK constraint is evaluated and
 cast to a NUMERIC value in the same way as a [CAST expression](lang_expr.html#castexpr). If the 
 result is zero (integer value 0 or real value 0\.0\), then a constraint
 violation has occurred. If the CHECK expression evaluates to NULL, or
 any other non\-zero value, it is not a constraint violation.
 The expression of a CHECK constraint may not contain a subquery.



CHECK constraints are only verified when the table is written, not when
 it is read. Furthermore, verification of CHECK constraints can be
 temporarily disabled using the "[PRAGMA ignore\_check\_constraints\=ON;](pragma.html#pragma_ignore_check_constraints)"
 statement. Hence, it is possible that a query might produce results that
 violate the CHECK constraints.
