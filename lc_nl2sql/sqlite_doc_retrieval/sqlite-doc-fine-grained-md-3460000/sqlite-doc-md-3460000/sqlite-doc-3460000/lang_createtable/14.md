## 4\.1\. Response to constraint violations


The response to a constraint violation is determined by the
 [constraint conflict resolution algorithm](lang_conflict.html). Each 
 PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL and CHECK constraint has a default conflict
 resolution algorithm. PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints may be
 explicitly assigned another default conflict resolution algorithm by
 including a [conflict\-clause](syntax/conflict-clause.html) in their definitions.
 Or, if a constraint definition does not include a [conflict\-clause](syntax/conflict-clause.html),
 the default conflict resolution algorithm is ABORT.
 The conflict resolution algorithm for CHECK constraints is always ABORT.
 (For historical compatibility only, table CHECK constraints are allowed
 to have a conflict resolution clause, but that has no effect.)
 Different constraints within the
 same table may have different default conflict resolution algorithms. See
 the section titled [ON CONFLICT](lang_conflict.html) for additional information.
