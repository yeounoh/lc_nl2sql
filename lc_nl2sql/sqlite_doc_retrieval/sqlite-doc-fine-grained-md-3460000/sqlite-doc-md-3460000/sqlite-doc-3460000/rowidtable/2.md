## 1\.0 Definition


A "rowid table" is any table in an SQLite schema that
* is *not* a [virtual table](vtab.html), and
* is *not* a [WITHOUT ROWID](withoutrowid.html) table.


Most tables in a typical SQLite database schema are rowid tables.

Rowid tables are distinguished by the fact that they all have
a unique, non\-NULL, signed 64\-bit integer [rowid](lang_createtable.html#rowid) that is used as
the access key for the data in the underlying [B\-tree](fileformat2.html#btree) storage engine.
