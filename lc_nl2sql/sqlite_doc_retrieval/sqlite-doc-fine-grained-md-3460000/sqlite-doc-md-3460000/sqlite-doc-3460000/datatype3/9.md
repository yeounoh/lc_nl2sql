## 3\.3\. Column Affinity For Views And Subqueries


The "columns" of a [VIEW](lang_createview.html) or FROM\-clause subquery are really
the expressions
in the result set of the [SELECT](lang_select.html) statement that implements the VIEW
or subquery. Thus, the affinity for columns of a VIEW or subquery
are determined by the expression affinity rules above.
Consider an example:




> ```
> 
> CREATE TABLE t1(a INT, b TEXT, c REAL);
> CREATE VIEW v1(x,y,z) AS SELECT b, a+c, 42 FROM t1 WHERE b!=11;
> 
> ```


The affinity of the v1\.x column will be the same as the affinity
of t1\.b (TEXT), since v1\.x maps directly into t1\.b. But
columns v1\.y and v1\.z both have no affinity, since those columns
map into expression a\+c and 42, and expressions always have no
affinity.
