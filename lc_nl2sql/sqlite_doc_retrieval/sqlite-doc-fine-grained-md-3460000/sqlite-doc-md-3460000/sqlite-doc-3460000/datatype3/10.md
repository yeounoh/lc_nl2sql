### 3\.3\.1\. Column Affinity For Compound Views


When the [SELECT](lang_select.html) statement that implements a [VIEW](lang_createview.html) or 
FROM\-clause subquery is a [compound SELECT](lang_select.html#compound) then the affinity of 
each column of the VIEW or subquery will
be the affinity of the corresponding result column for
one of the individual SELECT statements that make up 
the compound. 
However, it is indeterminate which of the SELECT statements will 
be used to determine affinity.
Different constituent SELECT statements might be used to determine 
affinity at different times during query evaluation. The choice
might vary across different versions of SQLite. The choice might
change between one query and the next in the same version of SQLite.
The choice might be different at different times within the same
query. Hence, you can never be sure what affinity will be used
for columns of a compound SELECT that have different affinities in
the constituent subqueries.



Best practice is to avoid mixing affinities in a compound SELECT
if you care about the datatype of the result. Mixing affinities in
a compound SELECT can lead to surprising and unintuitive results.
