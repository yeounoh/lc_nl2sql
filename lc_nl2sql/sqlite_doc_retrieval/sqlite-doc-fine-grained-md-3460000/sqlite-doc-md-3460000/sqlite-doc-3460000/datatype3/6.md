## 3\.1\. Determination Of Column Affinity


For tables not declared as [STRICT](stricttables.html),
the affinity of a column is determined by the declared type
of the column, according to the following rules in the order shown:


1. If the declared type contains the string "INT" then it
 is assigned INTEGER affinity.
2. If the declared type of the column contains any of the strings
 "CHAR", "CLOB", or "TEXT" then that
 column has TEXT affinity. Notice that the type VARCHAR contains the
 string "CHAR" and is thus assigned TEXT affinity.
3. If the declared type for a column
 contains the string "BLOB" or if
 no type is specified then the column has affinity BLOB.
4. If the declared type for a column
 contains any of the strings "REAL", "FLOA",
 or "DOUB" then the column has REAL affinity.
5. Otherwise, the affinity is NUMERIC.


Note that the order of the rules for determining column affinity
is important. A column whose declared type is "CHARINT" will match
both rules 1 and 2 but the first rule takes precedence and so the 
column affinity will be INTEGER.
