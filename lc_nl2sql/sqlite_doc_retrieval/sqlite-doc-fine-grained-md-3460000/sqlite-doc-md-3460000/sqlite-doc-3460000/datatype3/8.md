## 3\.2\. Affinity Of Expressions


Every table column has a type affinity (one of BLOB, TEXT, INTEGER,
REAL, or NUMERIC) but expressions do not necessarily have an affinity.



Expression affinity is determined by the following rules:



* The right\-hand operand of an IN or NOT IN
 operator has no affinity if the operand is a list, or has the same
 affinity as the affinity of the result set expression if the operand
 is a SELECT.
* When an expression is a simple reference to a column of a
 real table (not a [VIEW](lang_createview.html) or subquery) then the expression
 has the same affinity as the table column.
 


	+ Parentheses around the column name are ignored. Hence if
	 X and Y.Z are column names, then (X) and (Y.Z) are also considered
	 column names and have the affinity of the corresponding columns.
	+ Any operators applied to column names, including the no\-op 
	 unary "\+" operator, convert the column name into an expression which
	 always has no affinity. Hence even if X and Y.Z are column names, the
	 expressions \+X and \+Y.Z are not column names and have no affinity.
* An expression of the form "CAST(*expr* AS *type*)"
 has an affinity that is the same as a column with a declared
 type of "*type*".
* A COLLATE operator has the same affinity as its left\-hand side operand.
* Otherwise, an expression has no affinity.
