## 4\.3\. Comparison Example



> ```
> 
> CREATE TABLE t1(
>     a TEXT,      -- text affinity
>     b NUMERIC,   -- numeric affinity
>     c BLOB,      -- no affinity
>     d            -- no affinity
> );
> 
> -- Values will be stored as TEXT, INTEGER, TEXT, and INTEGER respectively
> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES('500', '500', '500', 500);
> SELECT typeof(a), typeof(b), typeof(c), typeof(d) FROM t1;
> text|integer|text|integer
> 
> -- Because column "a" has text affinity, numeric values on the
> -- right-hand side of the comparisons are converted to text before
> -- the comparison occurs.
> SELECT a < 40,   a < 60,   a < 600 FROM t1;
> 0|1|1
> 
> -- Text affinity is applied to the right-hand operands but since
> -- they are already TEXT this is a no-op; no conversions occur.
> SELECT a < '40', a < '60', a < '600' FROM t1;
> 0|1|1
> 
> -- Column "b" has numeric affinity and so numeric affinity is applied
> -- to the operands on the right.  Since the operands are already numeric,
> -- the application of affinity is a no-op; no conversions occur.  All
> -- values are compared numerically.
> SELECT b < 40,   b < 60,   b < 600 FROM t1;
> 0|0|1
> 
> -- Numeric affinity is applied to operands on the right, converting them
> -- from text to integers.  Then a numeric comparison occurs.
> SELECT b < '40', b < '60', b < '600' FROM t1;
> 0|0|1
> 
> -- No affinity conversions occur.  Right-hand side values all have
> -- storage class INTEGER which are always less than the TEXT values
> -- on the left.
> SELECT c < 40,   c < 60,   c < 600 FROM t1;
> 0|0|0
> 
> -- No affinity conversions occur.  Values are compared as TEXT.
> SELECT c < '40', c < '60', c < '600' FROM t1;
> 0|1|1
> 
> -- No affinity conversions occur.  Right-hand side values all have
> -- storage class INTEGER which compare numerically with the INTEGER
> -- values on the left.
> SELECT d < 40,   d < 60,   d < 600 FROM t1;
> 0|0|1
> 
> -- No affinity conversions occur.  INTEGER values on the left are
> -- always less than TEXT values on the right.
> SELECT d < '40', d < '60', d < '600' FROM t1;
> 1|1|1

All of the results in the example are the same if the comparisons are
commuted \- if expressions of the form "a\<40" are rewritten
as "40\>a".
