# 7\. Collating Sequences


When SQLite compares two strings, it uses a collating sequence or
collating function (two terms for the same thing) to determine which
string is greater or if the two strings are equal.
SQLite has three built\-in collating functions: BINARY, NOCASE, and 
RTRIM.


* **BINARY** \- Compares string data using memcmp(), regardless
 of text encoding.
* **NOCASE** \- Similar to binary, except that it uses
 [sqlite3\_strnicmp()](c3ref/stricmp.html) for the comparison. Hence the 26 upper case
 characters of ASCII are folded to their lower case equivalents before
 the comparison is performed. Note that only ASCII characters
 are case folded. SQLite does not attempt to do full
 UTF case folding due to the size of the tables required.
 Also note that any U\+0000 characters in the string are considered
 string terminators for comparison purposes.
* **RTRIM** \- The same as binary, except that trailing space
 characters are ignored.


An application can register additional collating functions using
the [sqlite3\_create\_collation()](c3ref/create_collation.html) interface.


Collating functions only matter when comparing string values.
Numeric values are always compared numerically, and BLOBs are always
compared byte\-by\-byte using memcmp().
