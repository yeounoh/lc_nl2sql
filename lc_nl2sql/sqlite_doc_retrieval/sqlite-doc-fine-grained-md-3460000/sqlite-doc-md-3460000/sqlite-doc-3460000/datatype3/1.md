# 1\. Datatypes In SQLite


Most SQL database engines (every SQL database engine other than SQLite,
as far as we know) uses static, rigid typing. With static typing, the datatype
of a value is determined by its container \- the particular column in
which the value is stored.


SQLite uses a more general dynamic type system. In SQLite, the datatype
of a value is associated with the value itself, not with its container.
The dynamic type system of SQLite is backwards
compatible with the more common static type systems of other database engines
in the sense that SQL statements that work on statically typed databases
work the same way in SQLite. However, the dynamic typing in SQLite allows
it to do things which are not possible in traditional rigidly typed
databases. [Flexible typing is a feature](flextypegood.html) of SQLite, not a bug.


Update:
As of version 3\.37\.0 (2021\-11\-27\), SQLite provides [STRICT tables](stricttables.html)
that do rigid type enforcement, for developers who prefer that kind of thing.
