## 4\.1\. Sort Order


The results of a comparison depend on the storage classes of the
operands, according to the following rules:


* A value with storage class NULL is considered less than any
 other value (including another value with storage class NULL).
* An INTEGER or REAL value is less than any TEXT or BLOB value.
 When an INTEGER or REAL is compared to another INTEGER or REAL, a
 numerical comparison is performed.
* A TEXT value is less than a BLOB value. When two TEXT values
 are compared an appropriate collating sequence is used to determine 
 the result.
* When two BLOB values are compared, the result is
 determined using memcmp().
