## 2\.2\. Date and Time Datatype


SQLite does not have a storage class set aside for storing
dates and/or times.
Instead, the built\-in [Date And Time Functions](lang_datefunc.html) of SQLite are capable of 
storing dates and times as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER values:


* **TEXT** as ISO8601 strings ("YYYY\-MM\-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS").
* **REAL** as Julian day numbers, the number of days since
noon in Greenwich on November 24, 4714 B.C. according to the
proleptic Gregorian calendar.
* **INTEGER** as Unix Time, the number of seconds since
1970\-01\-01 00:00:00 UTC.


Applications can choose to store dates and times in any of these
formats and freely convert between formats using the built\-in
[date and time functions](lang_datefunc.html).
