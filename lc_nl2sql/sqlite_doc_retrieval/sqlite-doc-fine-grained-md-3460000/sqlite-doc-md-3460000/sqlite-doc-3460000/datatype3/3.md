## 2\.1\. Boolean Datatype


SQLite does not have a separate Boolean storage class.
Instead, Boolean values are stored as integers 0 (false) and 1 (true).


SQLite recognizes the keywords "TRUE" and "FALSE",
as of version 3\.23\.0 (2018\-04\-02\) but those keywords are
really just alternative spellings for the integer literals 1 and 0
respectively.
