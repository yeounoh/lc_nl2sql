### Source Code Repositories



The SQLite source code is maintained in three geographically\-dispersed
self\-synchronizing
[Fossil](https://www.fossil-scm.org/) repositories that are
available for anonymous read\-only access. Anyone can
view the repository contents and download historical versions
of individual files or ZIP archives of historical check\-ins.
You can also [clone the entire repository](getthecode.html#clone).


See the [How To Compile SQLite](howtocompile.html) page for additional information
on how to use the raw SQLite source code.
Note that a recent version of [Tcl](https://www.tcl-lang.org/)
is required in order to build from the repository sources.
The [amalgamation](amalgamation.html) source code files
(the "sqlite3\.c" and "sqlite3\.h" files) build products and are
not contained in raw source code tree.
