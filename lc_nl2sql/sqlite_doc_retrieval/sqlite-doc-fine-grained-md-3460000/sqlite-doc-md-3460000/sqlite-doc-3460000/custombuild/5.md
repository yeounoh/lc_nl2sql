## 4\.0 Adding New Virtual File Systems


Since [version 3\.5\.0](releaselog/3_5_0.html) (2007\-09\-04\), 
SQLite has supported an interface called the
[virtual file system](c3ref/vfs.html) or "VFS".
This object is somewhat misnamed since it
is really an interface to the whole underlying operating system, not
just the filesystem.


 One of the interesting features
of the VFS interface is that SQLite can support multiple VFSes at the
same time. Each [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html) has to choose a single VFS for its
use when the connection is first opened using [sqlite3\_open\_v2()](c3ref/open.html).
But if a process contains multiple [database connections](c3ref/sqlite3.html) each can choose
a different VFS. VFSes can be added at run\-time using the
[sqlite3\_vfs\_register()](c3ref/vfs_find.html) interface.


The default builds for SQLite on Unix, Windows, and OS/2 include 
a VFS appropriate for the target platform. SQLite builds for other
operating systems do not contain a VFS by default, but the application
can register one or more at run\-time.
