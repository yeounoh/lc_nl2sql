## 3\.0 Configuring Or Replacing The Memory Allocation Subsystem


By default, SQLite obtains the memory it needs for objects and
cache from the malloc()/free() implementation of the standard library.
There is also on\-going work with experimental memory allocators that
satisfy all memory requests from a single fixed memory buffer handed
to SQLite at application start. Additional information on these
experimental memory allocators will be provided in a future revision
of this document.


SQLite supports the ability of an application to specify an alternative
memory allocator at run\-time by filling in an instance of the
[sqlite3\_mem\_methods](c3ref/mem_methods.html) object with pointers to the routines of the
alternative implementation then registering the new alternative
implementation using the [sqlite3\_config()](c3ref/config.html) interface.
For example:



> ```
> 
> sqlite3_config(SQLITE_CONFIG_MALLOC, &my_malloc_implementation);
> 
> ```


SQLite makes a copy of the content of the [sqlite3\_mem\_methods](c3ref/mem_methods.html) object
so the object can be modified after the [sqlite3\_config()](c3ref/config.html) call returns.
