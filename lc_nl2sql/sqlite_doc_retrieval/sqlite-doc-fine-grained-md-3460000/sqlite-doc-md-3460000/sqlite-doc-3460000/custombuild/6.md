## 5\.0 Porting SQLite To A New Operating System


In order to port SQLite to a new operating system \- an operating
system not supported by default \- the application
must provide...


* a working mutex subsystem (but only if it is multithreaded),
* a working memory allocation subsystem (assuming it lacks malloc()
in its standard library), and
* a working VFS implementation.


All of these things can be provided in a single auxiliary C code file
and then linked with the stock "sqlite3\.c" code file to generate a working
SQLite build for the target operating system. In addition to the
alternative mutex and memory allocation subsystems and the new VFS,
the auxiliary C code file should contain implementations for the
following two routines:


* [sqlite3\_os\_init()](c3ref/initialize.html)
* [sqlite3\_os\_end()](c3ref/initialize.html)


The "sqlite3\.c" code file contains default implementations of a VFS
and of the [sqlite3\_initialize()](c3ref/initialize.html) and [sqlite3\_shutdown()](c3ref/initialize.html) functions that
are appropriate for Unix, Windows, and OS/2\.
To prevent one of these default components from being loaded when sqlite3\.c
is compiled, it is necessary to add the following compile\-time
option:



> ```
> 
> -DSQLITE_OS_OTHER=1
> 
> ```


The SQLite core will call [sqlite3\_initialize()](c3ref/initialize.html) early. The auxiliary
C code file can contain an implementation of sqlite3\_initialize() that
registers an appropriate VFS and also perhaps initializes an alternative
mutex system (if mutexes are required) or does any memory allocation
subsystem initialization that is required.
The SQLite core never calls [sqlite3\_shutdown()](c3ref/initialize.html) but it is part of the
official SQLite API and is not otherwise provided when compiled with
\-DSQLITE\_OS\_OTHER\=1, so the auxiliary C code file should probably provide
it for completeness.
