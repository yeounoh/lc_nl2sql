# 5\. Verification Of Checksums


If any checksum is incorrect, the "PRAGMA quick\_check" command
will find it. To verify that checksums are actually enabled
and running, use SQL like the following:




```
SELECT count(*), verify_checksum(data)
  FROM sqlite_dbpage
 GROUP BY 2;

```

There are three possible outputs from the verify\_checksum()
function: 1, 0, and NULL. 1 is returned if the checksum is
correct. 0 is returned if the checksum is incorrect. NULL
is returned if the page is unreadable. If checksumming is
enabled, the read will fail if the checksum is wrong, so the
usual result from verify\_checksum() on a bad checksum is NULL.



If everything is OK, the query above should return a single
row where the second column is 1\. Any other result indicates
either that there is a checksum error, or checksum validation
is disabled.
