# 2\. Compiling


The checksum VFS module is a [loadable extension](loadext.html). It is not
included in the [amalgamation](amalgamation.html). It must be added to SQLite
either at compile\-time or at run\-time. The source code to
the checksum VFS module is in the
[ext/misc/cksumvfs.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/cksumvfs.c)
source file in the
[SQLite source tree](https://sqlite.org/src).



To build the checksum VFS module into a run\-time loadable
extension, use commands similar to the following:



* (linux) → gcc \-fPIC \-shared cksumvfs.c \-o cksumvfs.so
* (mac) → clang \-fPIC \-dynamiclib cksumvfs.c \-o cksumvfs.dylib
* (windows) → cl cksumvfs.c \-link \-dll \-out:cksumvfs.dll


You may want to add additional compiler options, of course,
according to the needs of your project.



To statically link this extension with your product,
compile it like any other C\-language module but add the
"\-DSQLITE\_CKSUMVFS\_STATIC" option so that this module knows that
it is being statically linked rather than dynamically linked.
