# 6\. Controlling Checksum Verification


The cksumvfs extension implements a new PRAGMA statement that can
be used to disable, re\-enable, or query the status of checksum
verification:




```
PRAGMA checksum_verification;          -- query status
PRAGMA checksum_verification=OFF;      -- disable verification
PRAGMA checksum_verification=ON;       -- re-enable verification

```

The "checksum\_verification" pragma will return "1" (true) or "0"
(false) if checksum verification is enabled or disabled, respectively.
"Verification" in this context means the feature that causes
SQLITE\_IOERR\_DATA errors if a checksum mismatch is detected while
reading. Checksums are always kept up\-to\-date as long as the
[reserve bytes](fileformat2.html#resbyte) value of the database is 8, regardless of the setting
of this pragma. Checksum verification can be disabled (for example)
to do forensic analysis of a database that has previously reported
a checksum error.



The "checksum\_verification" pragma will always respond with "0" if
the database file does not have a [reserve bytes](fileformat2.html#resbyte) value of 8\. The
pragma will return no rows at all if the cksumvfs extension is
not loaded.
