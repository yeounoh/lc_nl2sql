# 1\. Overview


The checksum VFS extension is a [VFS shim](vfs.html#shim) that adds an 8\-byte
checksum to the end of every page in an SQLite database. The checksum
is added as each page is written and verified as each page is read.
The checksum is intended to help detect database corruption caused by
random bit\-flips in the mass storage device.



The checksum VFS extension requires 
SQLite version 3\.32\.0 (2020\-05\-22\) or later. It will not
work with earlier versions of SQLite.
