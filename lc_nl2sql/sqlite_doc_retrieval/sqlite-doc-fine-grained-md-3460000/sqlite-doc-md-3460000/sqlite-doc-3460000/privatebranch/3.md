# 3\.  The Procedure


The remainder of this document will guide the reader through
the steps needed to maintain a private branch. The general idea
is the same as outlined above. This section merely provides more
detail.


We emphasize again that these steps are not intended to be the only
acceptable method for maintaining private branch. This approach
is one of many. Use this document as a baseline for preparing
project\-specific procedures. Do not be afraid to experiment.
