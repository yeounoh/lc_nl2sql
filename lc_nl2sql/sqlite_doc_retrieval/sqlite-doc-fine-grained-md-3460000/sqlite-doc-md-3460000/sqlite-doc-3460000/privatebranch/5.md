## 3\.2\.  Create A Project Repository


Create a fossil repository to host the private branch using the
following command:



> ```
> 
> fossil new private-project.fossil
> 
> ```


You can call your project anything you like. The ".fossil"
suffix is optional. For this document, we will continue to call the
project "private\-project.fossil". Note that
private\-project.fossil is an ordinary disk file (actually an
SQLite database) that will contain your complete project history.
You can make a backup of the project simply by making a copy of that
one file.


If you want to configure the new project, type:



> ```
> 
> fossil ui private-project.fossil
> 
> ```


The "ui" command will cause fossil to run a miniature built\-in webserver
and to launch your web\-browser pointing
at that webserver. You can use your web\-browser to configure your project
in various ways. See the instructions on the fossil website for additional
information.


Once the project repository is created, create an open checkout of the
project by moving to the directory where you want to keep all of the
project source code and typing:



> ```
> 
> fossil open private-project.fossil
> 
> ```


You can have multiple checkouts of the same project if you want. 
And you can "clone" the repository to different machines so that multiple
developers can use it. See the fossil website for further information.
