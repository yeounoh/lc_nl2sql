# 4\.  Variations


Since this document was first written, the canonical SQLite source code
has been moved from the venerable CVS system into a Fossil repository at
<https://www.sqlite.org/src>. This means that if you are working with
canonical SQLite source code (as opposed to the [amalgamation](amalgamation.html) source code
files, sqlite3\.c and sqlite3\.h) then you can create a private repository
simply by cloning the official repository:



> ```
> 
> fossil clone https://www.sqlite.org/src private-project.fossil
> 
> ```


This command both creates the new repository and populates it with
all the latest SQLite code. You can then create a private branch as
described in section 3\.4\.


When the private repository is created by cloning, incorporating new
public SQLite releases becomes much easier too. To pull in all of the
latest changes from the public SQLite repository, simply move into
the open check\-out and do:



> ```
> 
> fossil update
> 
> ```


Then continue to merge the changes in "trunk" with your "private"
changes as described in section 3\.7\.
