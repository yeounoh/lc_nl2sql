## 3\.4\.  Creating The Private Branch


The previous step created circle (1\) in the diagram above.
This step will create circle (2\). Run the following command:



> ```
>  
> fossil branch new private trunk -bgcolor "#add8e8"
> 
> ```


This command will create a new branch named "private" (you can use
a different name if you like) and assign it a background color
of light blue ("\#add8e8"). You can omit the background color if you want,
though having a distinct background does make it easier to tell the
branch from the "trunk" (the public branch) on timeline displays. You
can change the background color of the private branch or of the public
branch (the "trunk") using the web interface if you like.


The command above created the new branch. But your checkout is
still on the trunk \- a fact you can see by running the command:



> ```
> 
> fossil info
> 
> ```


To change your check\-out to the private branch, type:



> ```
> 
> fossil update private
> 
> ```


You can run the "info" command again to verify that you are on the
private branch. To go back to the public branch, type:



> ```
> 
> fossil update trunk
> 
> ```


Normally, fossil will modify all the files in your checkout when switching
between the private and the public branches. But at this point, the files
are identical in both branches so no modifications need to be made.
