## 3\.5\.  Adding Customizations To The Code In The Private Branch


Now it is time to make the private, custom modifications to SQLite
which are the whole point of this exercise. Switch to the private branch
(if you are not already there) using the "fossil update private"
command, then bring up the source files in your text editor and make
whatever changes you want to make. Once you have finished making
changes, commit those changes using this command:



> ```
> 
> fossil commit
> 
> ```


You will be prompted once again to enter a commit describing your
changes. Then the commit will occur. The commit creates a new checkin
in the repository that corresponds to circle (3\) in the diagram above.


Now that the public and private branches are different, you can run
the "fossil update trunk" and "fossil update private"
commands and see that fossil really does change the files in the checkout
as you switch back and forth between branches.


Note that in the diagram above, we showed the private edits as a single
commit. This was for clarity of presentation only. There is nothing to stop
you from doing dozens or hundreds of separate tiny changes and committing
each separately. In fact, making many small changes is the preferred way
to work. The only reason for doing all the changes in a single commit
is that it makes the diagram easier to draw.
