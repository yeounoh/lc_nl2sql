## 3\.7\.  Merging Public SQLite Updates Into The Private Branch


The next step is to move the changes in the public branch over into
the private branch. In other words, we want to create circle (5\) in the
diagram above. Begin by changing to the private branch using
"fossil update private". Then type this command:



> ```
> 
> fossil merge trunk
> 
> ```


The "merge" command attempts to apply all the changes between
circles (1\) and (4\) to the files in the local checkout. Note that
circle (5\) has not been created yet. You will need to run the
"commit" to create circle (5\).


It might be that there are conflicts in the merge. Conflicts
occur when the same line of code was changed in different ways between
circles (1\) and (4\) versus circles (2\) and (3\). The merge command will
announce any conflicts and will include both versions of the conflicting
lines in the output. You will need to bring up the files that contain
conflicts and manually resolve the conflicts.


After resolving conflicts, many users like to compile and test the
new version before committing it to the repository. Or you can commit
first and test later. Either way, run the "fossil commit"
command to check\-in the circle (5\) version.
