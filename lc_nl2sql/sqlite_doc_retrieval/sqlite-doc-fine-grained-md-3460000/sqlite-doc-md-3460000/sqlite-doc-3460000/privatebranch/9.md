## 3\.6\.  Incorporating New Public SQLite Releases


Suppose that after a while (about a month, usually) a new version of
SQLite is released: 3\.6\.16\. You will want to incorporate this new
public version of SQLite into your repository in the public branch (the
trunk). To do this, first change your repository over to the trunk:



> ```
> 
> fossil update trunk
> 
> ```


Then download the new version of the SQLite sources and overwrite the
files that are in the checkout.




If you made NL to CR\-NL line ending changes or space to tab
indentation changes in the original baseline, make the same changes
to the new source file.


Once everything is ready, run the "fossil commit" command to
check in the changes. This creates circle (4\) in the diagram above.
