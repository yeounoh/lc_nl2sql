# 1\.  Introduction


SQLite is designed to meet most developer's needs without any 
changes or customization. When changes are needed, they can normally
be accomplished using start\-time [(1\)](c3ref/config.html)
or runtime
[(2\)](c3ref/db_config.html)
[(3\)](c3ref/limit.html)
[(4\)](c3ref/vfs_find.html) configuration methods
or via [compile\-time options](compile.html). It is very rare that an application 
developer will need to edit the SQLite source code in order to 
incorporate SQLite into a product.




We call custom modifications to the SQLite source code that are held
for the use of a single application a "private branch". When a private
branch becomes necessary, the application developer must take on the
task of keeping the private branch in synchronization with the public
SQLite sources. This is tedious. It can also be tricky, since while
the SQLite file format and published interfaces are very stable, the
internal implementation of SQLite changes quite rapidly. Hundreds or
thousands of lines of code might change for any given SQLite point release.



This article outlines one possible method for keeping a private branch
of SQLite in sync with the public SQLite source code.
There are many ways of maintaining a private branch, of course.
Nobody is compelled to use the method describe here.
This article is not trying to impose a particular procedure on 
maintainers of private branches. The point of this article is to offer
an example of one process for maintaining a private branch which can
be used as a template for designing processes best suited for the
circumstances of each individual project.
