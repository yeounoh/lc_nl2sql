# 1\. Introduction



An "SQLite Archive" is a file container similar to a
[ZIP archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)) or
[Tarball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)) but
based on an SQLite database.




An SQLite Archive is an ordinary SQLite database file that contains the
following table as part of its schema:




```
CREATE TABLE sqlar(
  name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- name of the file
  mode INT,               -- access permissions
  mtime INT,              -- last modification time
  sz INT,                 -- original file size
  data BLOB               -- compressed content
);

```


Each row of the SQLAR table holds the content of a single file.
The filename (the full pathname relative to the root of the archive)
is in the "name" field.
The "mode" field is an integer which is the unix\-style access permissions
for the file. "mtime" is the modification time of the file in seconds
since 1970\. "sz" is the original uncompressed size of the file.
The "data" field contains the file content. The content is usually
compressed using [Deflate](http://zlib.net/), though not always. If the
"sz" field is equal to the size of the "data" field, then the content
is stored uncompressed.
