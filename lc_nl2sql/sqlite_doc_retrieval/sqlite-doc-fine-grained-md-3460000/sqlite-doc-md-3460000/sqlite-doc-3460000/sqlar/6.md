# 4\. Managing An SQLite Archive From The Command\-Line



The recommended way of creating, updating, listing, and extracting
an SQLite Archive is to use the [sqlite3\.exe command\-line shell](cli.html)
for SQLite [version 3\.23\.0](releaselog/3_23_0.html) (2018\-04\-02\) or later. This CLI
supports the \-A command\-line option that allows easy management
of SQLite Archives.
The CLI for SQLite [version 3\.22\.0](releaselog/3_22_0.html) (2018\-01\-22\) has the
[.archive command](cli.html#sqlar) for managing SQLite Archives, but that requires
interacting with the shell.




To list all of the files in an SQLite Archive named "example.sqlar"
using one of these commands:




```
sqlite3 example.sqlar -At
sqlite3 example.sqlar -Atv

```


To extract all files from an SQLite Archive named "example.sqlar":




```
sqlite3 example.sqlar -Ax

```


To create a new SQLite Archive named "alltxt.sqlar" containing all \*.txt
files in the current directory:




```
sqlite3 alltxt.sqlar -Ac *.txt

```


To add or update files in an existing SQLite Archive:




```
sqlite3 example.sqlar -Au *.md

```


For usage hints and a summary of all options, simply give the [CLI](cli.html)
the \-A option with no additional arguments:




```
sqlite3 -A

```


All of these commands work the same way if the filename argument is
is a ZIP Archive instead of an SQLite database.
