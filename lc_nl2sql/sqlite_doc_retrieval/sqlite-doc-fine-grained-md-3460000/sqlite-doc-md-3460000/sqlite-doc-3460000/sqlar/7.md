## 4\.1\. Other command\-line tools



Just as there is the "zip" program to manage ZIP Archives, and the
"tar" program to manage Tarballs, the
["sqlar" program](https://sqlite.org/sqlar) exists to manage SQL Archives.
The "sqlar" program is able to create a new SQLite Archive, list the
content of an existing archive, add or remove files from the archive,
and/or extract files from the archive.
A separate "sqlarfs" program is able to mount the SQLite Archive as
a [Fuse Filesystem](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse).
