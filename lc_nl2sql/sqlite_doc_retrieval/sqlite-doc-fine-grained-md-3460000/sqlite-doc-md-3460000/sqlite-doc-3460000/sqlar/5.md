# 3\. Disadvantages Of SQLite Archives


1. The SQLite Archive is a relatively new format. It was first described in
in 2014\. ZIP Archives and Tarballs, on the other hand, have been around
for decades and are well\-entrenched as standard formats. Most programmers
know what a ZIP Archive or Tarball is, but if you say "SQLite Archive" you
are more likely to get a reply of "What?" Tooling to process ZIP Archives
and Tarballs is more likely to be installed on stock computers.
2. Since an SQLite database is a more general format (it is designed to do
much more than simply store a bunch of files) it is not as compact as either
the ZIP Archive or Tarball formats. An SQLite Archive is usually about 1%
larger than the equivalent ZIP Archive. Tarballs are compressed as a single
unit rather than compressing each file separately as is done by both
SQLite and ZIP Archives. For these reason, Tarballs tend to be smaller
than either ZIP or SQLite Archives.



As an example, the following table show the relative sizes for an
SQLite Archive, a ZIP Archive, and a Tarball of the 1,743 files
in the SQLite 3\.22\.0 source tree:




| SQLite Archive | 10,754,048 |
| --- | --- |
| ZIP Archive (using Info\-ZIP 3\.0\) | 10,662,365 |
| ZIP Archive (using [zipfile](zipfile.html)) | 10,390,215 |
| Tarball | 9,781,109 |
3. An SQLite Archive supports only the [Deflate](https://zlib.net/) compression
method. Tarballs and ZIP Archive support a wider assortment of
compression methods.
