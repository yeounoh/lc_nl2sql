# 8\. The editdist3 function


The editdist3 algorithm is a function that computes the minimum edit 
distance (a.k.a. the Levenshtein distance) between two input strings.
The editdist3 algorithm is a configurable alternative to the default
edit distance function of spellfix1\.
Features of editdist3 include:



* It works with unicode (UTF8\) text.
* A table of insertion, deletion, and substitution costs can be 
 provided by the application.
* Multi\-character insertions, deletions, and substitutions can be
 enumerated in the cost table.
