# 5\. Configurable Edit Distance


The built\-in Wagner edit\-distance function with fixed weights can be
replaced by the [editdist3()](spellfix1.html#editdist3) edit\-distance function
with application\-defined weights and support for unicode, by specifying
the "edit\_cost\_table\=*TABLENAME*" parameter to the spellfix1 module
when the virtual table is created.
For example:




> ```
> 
> CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE demo2 USING spellfix1(edit_cost_table=APPCOST);
> 
> ```


The [editdist3()](spellfix1.html#editdist3) edit\-distance function can also be selected or 
deselected at run\-time by inserting an appropriate string into the
"command" column of the virtual table:



> ```
> 
> INSERT INTO demo2(command) VALUES('edit_cost_table=APPCOST');
> 
> ```


In the examples above, the APPCOST table would be interrogated to find
the edit distance coefficients. It is the presence of the "edit\_cost\_table\="
parameter to the spellfix1 module name that causes editdist3() to be used
in place of the built\-in edit distance function. If APPCOST is an empty
string, then the built\-in Wagner edit\-distance function is used.



The edit distance coefficients are normally read from the APPCOST table
once and there after stored in memory. Hence, run\-time changes to the
APPCOST table will not normally affect the edit distance results.
However, inserting the special string 'reset' into the "command" column of the
virtual table causes the edit distance coefficients to be reread the
APPCOST table. Hence, applications should run a SQL statement similar
to the following when changes to the APPCOST table occur:




> INSERT INTO demo2(command) VALUES("reset");
