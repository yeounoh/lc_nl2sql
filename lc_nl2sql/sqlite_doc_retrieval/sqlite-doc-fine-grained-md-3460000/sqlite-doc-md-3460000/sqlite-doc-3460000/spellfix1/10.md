# 10\. Experimenting with the editcost3() function


The spellfix1 virtual table
uses editdist3 if the "edit\_cost\_table\=TABLE" option
is specified as an argument when the spellfix1 virtual table is created. 
But editdist3 can also be tested directly using the built\-in "editdist3()"
SQL function. The editdist3() SQL function has 3 forms:



1. editdist3('TABLENAME');
2. editdist3('string1', 'string2');
3. editdist3('string1', 'string2', langid);


The first form loads the edit distance coefficients from a table called
'TABLENAME'. Any prior coefficients are discarded. So when experimenting
with weights and the weight table changes, simply rerun the single\-argument
form of editdist3() to reload revised coefficients. Note that the 
edit distance
weights used by the editdist3() SQL function are independent from the
weights used by the spellfix1 virtual table.



The second and third forms return the computed edit distance between strings
'string1' and "string2'. In the second form, a language id of 0 is used.
The language id is specified in the third form.
