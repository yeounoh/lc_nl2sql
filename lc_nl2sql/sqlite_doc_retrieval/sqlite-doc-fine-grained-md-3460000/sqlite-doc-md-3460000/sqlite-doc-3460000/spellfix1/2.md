# 2\. Search Refinements


By default, the spellfix1 table returns no more than 20 results.
(It might return less than 20 if there were fewer good matches.)
You can change the upper bound on the number of returned rows by
adding a "top\=N" term to the WHERE clause of your query, where N
is the new maximum. For example, to see the 5 best matches:




> ```
> 
> SELECT word FROM demo WHERE word MATCH 'kennes*' AND top=5;
> 
> ```


Each entry in the spellfix1 virtual table is associated with
a particular language, identified by the integer "langid" column.
The default langid is 0 and if no other actions are taken, the
entire vocabulary is a part of the 0 language. But if your application
needs to operate in multiple languages, then you can specify different
vocabulary items for each language by specifying the langid field
when populating the table. For example:




> ```
> 
> INSERT INTO demo(word,langid) SELECT word, 0 FROM en_vocabulary;
> INSERT INTO demo(word,langid) SELECT word, 1 FROM de_vocabulary;
> INSERT INTO demo(word,langid) SELECT word, 2 FROM fr_vocabulary;
> INSERT INTO demo(word,langid) SELECT word, 3 FROM ru_vocabulary;
> INSERT INTO demo(word,langid) SELECT word, 4 FROM cn_vocabulary;
> 
> ```


After the virtual table has been populated with items from multiple
languages, specify the language of interest using a "langid\=N" term
in the WHERE clause of the query:




> ```
> 
> SELECT word FROM demo WHERE word MATCH 'hildes*' AND langid=1;
> 
> ```


Note that if you do not include the "langid\=N" term in the WHERE clause,
the search will be against language 0 (English in the example above.)
All spellfix1 searches are against a single language id. There is no
way to search all languages at once.
