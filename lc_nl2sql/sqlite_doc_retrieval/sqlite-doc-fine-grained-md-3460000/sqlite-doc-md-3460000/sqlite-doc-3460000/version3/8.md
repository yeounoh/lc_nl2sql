### Improved Concurrency



SQLite version 2\.8 allowed multiple simultaneous readers or a single
writer but not both. SQLite version 3\.0 allows one process to begin
writing the database while other processes continue to read. The
writer must still obtain an exclusive lock on the database for a brief
interval in order to commit its changes, but the exclusive lock is no
longer required for the entire write operation.
A [more detailed report](lockingv3.html) on the locking
behavior of SQLite version 3\.0 is available separately.




A limited form of table\-level locking is now also available in SQLite.
If each table is stored in a separate database file, those separate
files can be attached to the main database (using the ATTACH command)
and the combined databases will function as one. But locks will only
be acquired on individual files as needed. So if you redefine "database"
to mean two or more database files, then it is entirely possible for
two processes to be writing to the same database at the same time.
To further support this capability, commits of transactions involving
two or more ATTACHed database are now atomic.
