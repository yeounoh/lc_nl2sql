### Naming Changes



SQLite version 2\.8 will continue to be supported with bug fixes
for the foreseeable future. In order to allow SQLite version 2\.8
and SQLite version 3\.0 to peacefully coexist, the names of key files
and APIs in SQLite version 3\.0 have been changed to include the
character "3". For example, the include file used by C programs
has been changed from "sqlite.h" to "sqlite3\.h". And the name of
the shell program used to interact with databases has been changed
from "sqlite.exe" to "sqlite3\.exe". With these changes, it is possible
to have both SQLite 2\.8 and SQLite 3\.0 installed on the same system at
the same time. And it is possible for the same C program to link
against both SQLite 2\.8 and SQLite 3\.0 at the same time and to use
both libraries at the same time.
