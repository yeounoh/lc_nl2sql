### User\-defined Collating Sequences



A collating sequence is just a defined order for text. When SQLite 3\.0
sorts (or uses a comparison operator like "\<" or "\>\=") the sort
order is first determined by the data type.



* NULLs sort first
* Numeric values sort next in numerical order
* Text values come after numerics
* BLOBs sort last



Collating sequences are used for comparing two text strings.
The collating sequence does not change the ordering of NULLs, numbers,
or BLOBs, only text.




A collating sequence is implemented as a function that takes the
two strings being compared as inputs and returns negative, zero, or
positive if the first string is less than, equal to, or greater than
the second.
SQLite 3\.0 comes with a single built\-in collating sequence named "BINARY"
which is implemented using the memcmp() routine from the standard C library.
The BINARY collating sequence works well for English text. For other
languages or locales, alternative collating sequences may be preferred.




The decision of which collating sequence to use is controlled by the
COLLATE clause in SQL. A COLLATE clause can occur on a table definition,
to define a default collating sequence to a table column, or on field
of an index, or in the ORDER BY clause of a SELECT statement.
Planned enhancements to SQLite are to include standard CAST() syntax
to allow the collating sequence of an expression to be defined.
