### 64\-bit ROWIDs



Every row of a table has a unique rowid.
If the table defines a column with the type "INTEGER PRIMARY KEY" then that
column becomes an alias for the rowid. But with or without an INTEGER PRIMARY
KEY column, every row still has a rowid.




In SQLite version 3\.0, the rowid is a 64\-bit signed integer.
This is an expansion of SQLite version 2\.8 which only permitted
rowids of 32\-bits.




To minimize storage space, the 64\-bit rowid is stored as a variable length
integer. Rowids between 0 and 127 use only a single byte. 
Rowids between 0 and 16383 use just 2 bytes. Up to 2097152 uses three
bytes. And so forth. Negative rowids are allowed but they always use
nine bytes of storage and so their use is discouraged. When rowids
are generated automatically by SQLite, they will always be non\-negative.
