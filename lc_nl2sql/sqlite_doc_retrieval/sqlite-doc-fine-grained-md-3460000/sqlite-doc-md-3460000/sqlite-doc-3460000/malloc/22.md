## 4\.2\.  Ductile failure


If the memory allocation subsystems within SQLite are configured
for breakdown\-free operation but the actual memory usage exceeds
design limits set by the [Robson proof](malloc.html#nofrag), SQLite will usually continue 
to operate normally.
The [pagecache memory allocator](malloc.html#pagecache)
and the [lookaside memory allocator](malloc.html#lookaside) automatically failover
to the [memsys5](malloc.html#memsys5) general\-purpose memory allocator. And it is usually the
case that the [memsys5](malloc.html#memsys5) memory allocator will continue to function
without fragmentation even if **M** and/or **n** exceeds the limits
imposed by the [Robson proof](malloc.html#nofrag). The [Robson proof](malloc.html#nofrag) shows that it is 
possible for a memory allocation to break down and fail in this 
circumstance, but such a failure requires an especially
despicable sequence of allocations and deallocations \- a sequence that
SQLite has never been observed to follow. So in practice it is usually
the case that the limits imposed by Robson can be exceeded by a
considerable margin with no ill effect.


Nevertheless, application developers are admonished to monitor
the state of the memory allocation subsystems and raise alarms when
memory usage approaches or exceeds Robson limits. In this way,
the application will provide operators with abundant warning well
in advance of failure.
The [memory statistics](malloc.html#memstatus) interfaces of SQLite provide the application with
all the mechanism necessary to complete the monitoring portion of
this task.
