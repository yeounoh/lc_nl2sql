### 3\.1\.1\. The default memory allocator


By default, SQLite uses the malloc(), realloc(), and free() routines
from the standard C library for its memory allocation needs. These routines
are surrounded by a thin wrapper that also provides a "memsize()" function
that will return the size of an existing allocation. The memsize() function
is needed to keep an accurate count of the number of bytes of outstanding
memory; memsize() determines how many bytes to remove from the outstanding
count when an allocation is freed. The default allocator implements
memsize() by always allocating 8 extra bytes on each malloc() request and
storing the size of the allocation in that 8\-byte header.


The default memory allocator is recommended for most applications.
If you do not have a compelling need to use an alternative memory
allocator, then use the default.
