### 3\.1\.8\. No\-op memory allocator stub


If SQLite is compiled with the [SQLITE\_ZERO\_MALLOC](compile.html#zero_malloc) option, then
the [default memory allocator](malloc.html#defaultalloc) is omitted and replaced by a stub
memory allocator that never allocates any memory. Any calls to the
stub memory allocator will report back that no memory is available.


The no\-op memory allocator is not useful by itself. It exists only
as a placeholder so that SQLite has a memory allocator to link against
on systems that may not have malloc(), free(), or realloc() in their
standard library.
An application that is compiled with [SQLITE\_ZERO\_MALLOC](compile.html#zero_malloc) will need to
use [sqlite3\_config()](c3ref/config.html) together with [SQLITE\_CONFIG\_MALLOC](c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfigmalloc) or
[SQLITE\_CONFIG\_HEAP](c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfigheap) to specify a new alternative memory allocator
before beginning to use SQLite.
