# Overview


SQLite uses dynamic memory allocation to obtain
memory for storing various objects
(ex: [database connections](c3ref/sqlite3.html) and [prepared statements](c3ref/stmt.html)) and to build
a memory cache of the database file and to hold the results of queries.
Much effort has gone into making the dynamic memory allocation subsystem
of SQLite reliable, predictable, robust, secure, and efficient.


This document provides an overview of dynamic memory allocation within 
SQLite. The target audience is software engineers who are tuning their
use of SQLite for peak performance in demanding environments.
Nothing in this document is required knowledge for using SQLite. The
default settings and configuration for SQLite will work well in most
applications. However, the information contained in this document may
be useful to engineers who are tuning SQLite to comply with special
requirements or to run under unusual circumstances.
