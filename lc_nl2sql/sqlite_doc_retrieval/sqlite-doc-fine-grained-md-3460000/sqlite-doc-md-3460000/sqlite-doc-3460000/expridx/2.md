# 2\. Restrictions



There are certain reasonable restrictions on expressions that appear in
CREATE INDEX statements:



1. Expressions in CREATE INDEX statements
may only refer to columns of the table being indexed, not to
columns in other tables.
2. Expressions in CREATE INDEX statements
may contain function calls, but only to functions whose output
is always determined completely by its input parameters (a.k.a.:
[deterministic functions](deterministic.html)). Obviously, functions like [random()](lang_corefunc.html#random) will not
work well in an index. But also functions like [sqlite\_version()](lang_corefunc.html#sqlite_version), though
they are constant across any one database connection, are not constant
across the life of the underlying database file, and hence may not be
used in a CREATE INDEX statement.




Note that [application\-defined SQL functions](appfunc.html) are by default considered
non\-deterministic and may not be used in a CREATE INDEX statement unless
the [SQLITE\_DETERMINISTIC](c3ref/c_deterministic.html#sqlitedeterministic) flag is used when the function is registered.
3. Expressions in CREATE INDEX statements may not use subqueries.
4. Expressions may only be used in CREATE INDEX statements, not within
[UNIQUE](lang_createtable.html#uniqueconst) or [PRIMARY KEY](lang_createtable.html#primkeyconst) constraints within the [CREATE TABLE](lang_createtable.html) statement.
