1. The [query planner checklist](queryplanner-ng.html#howtofix) describes steps that application
developers should following to help resolve query planner problems.
Notice the that the use of INDEXED BY is a last resort, to be used only
when all other measures fail.
2. [The unary "\+" operator](optoverview.html#uplus)
can be used to disqualify terms in the WHERE clause from use by indices.
Careful use of unary \+ can sometimes help prevent the query planner from
choosing a poor index without restricting it to using one specific index.
Careful placement of unary \+ operators is a better method for controlling 
which indices are used by a query.
3. The [sqlite3\_stmt\_status()](c3ref/stmt_status.html) C/C\+\+ interface together with the
[SQLITE\_STMTSTATUS\_FULLSCAN\_STEP](c3ref/c_stmtstatus_counter.html#sqlitestmtstatusfullscanstep) and [SQLITE\_STMTSTATUS\_SORT](c3ref/c_stmtstatus_counter.html#sqlitestmtstatussort) verbs
can be used to detect at run\-time when an SQL statement is not
making effective use of indices. Many applications may prefer to
use the [sqlite3\_stmt\_status()](c3ref/stmt_status.html) interface to detect index misuse
rather than the INDEXED BY phrase described here.
