# 7\. TEMP Triggers on Non\-TEMP Tables


A trigger normally exists in the same database as the table named
after the "ON" keyword in the CREATE TRIGGER statement. Except, it is
possible to create a TEMP TRIGGER on a table in another database. 
Such a trigger will only fire when changes
are made to the target table by the application that defined the trigger.
Other applications that modify the database will not be able to see the
TEMP trigger and hence cannot run the trigger.


When defining a TEMP trigger on a non\-TEMP table, it is important to
specify the database holding the non\-TEMP table. For example,
in the following statement, it is important to say "main.tab1" instead
of just "tab1":



> ```
> 
> CREATE TEMP TRIGGER ex1 AFTER INSERT ON main.tab1 BEGIN ...
> 
> ```


Failure to specify the schema name on the target table could result
in the TEMP trigger being reattached to a table with the same name in
another database whenever any schema change occurs.
