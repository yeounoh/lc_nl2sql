# 4\. Some Example Triggers


Assuming that customer records are stored in the "customers" table, and
that order records are stored in the "orders" table, the following
UPDATE trigger
ensures that all associated orders are redirected when a customer changes
his or her address:



> ```
> 
> CREATE TRIGGER update_customer_address UPDATE OF address ON customers 
>   BEGIN
>     UPDATE orders SET address = new.address WHERE customer_name = old.name;
>   END;
> 
> ```


With this trigger installed, executing the statement:



> ```
> 
> UPDATE customers SET address = '1 Main St.' WHERE name = 'Jack Jones';
> 
> ```


causes the following to be automatically executed:



> ```
> 
> UPDATE orders SET address = '1 Main St.' WHERE customer_name = 'Jack Jones';
> 
> ```


For an example of an INSTEAD OF trigger, consider the following schema:


> ```
> 
> CREATE TABLE customer(
>   cust_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
>   cust_name TEXT,
>   cust_addr TEXT
> );
> CREATE VIEW customer_address AS
>    SELECT cust_id, cust_addr FROM customer;
> CREATE TRIGGER cust_addr_chng
> INSTEAD OF UPDATE OF cust_addr ON customer_address
> BEGIN
>   UPDATE customer SET cust_addr=NEW.cust_addr
>    WHERE cust_id=NEW.cust_id;
> END;
> 
> ```




With the schema above, a statement of the form:



> ```
> 
> UPDATE customer_address SET cust_addr=$new_address WHERE cust_id=$cust_id;
> 
> ```


Causes the customer.cust\_addr field to be updated for a specific
customer entry that has customer.cust\_id equal to the $cust\_id parameter.
Note how the values assigned to the view are made available as field
in the special "NEW" table within the trigger body.
