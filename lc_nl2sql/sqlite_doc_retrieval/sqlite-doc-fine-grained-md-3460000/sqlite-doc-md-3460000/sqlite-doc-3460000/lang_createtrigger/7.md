# 6\. The RAISE() function


A special SQL function RAISE() may be used within a trigger\-program,
with the following syntax


**[raise\-function:](syntax/raise-function.html)**







RAISE



(



ROLLBACK



,



error\-message



)






IGNORE




ABORT




FAIL










When one of RAISE(ROLLBACK,...), RAISE(ABORT,...) or RAISE(FAIL,...)
is called during trigger\-program
execution, the specified [ON CONFLICT](lang_conflict.html) processing is performed and
the current query terminates.
An error code of [SQLITE\_CONSTRAINT](rescode.html#constraint) is returned to the application,
along with the specified error message.


When RAISE(IGNORE) is called, the remainder of the current trigger program,
the statement that caused the trigger program to execute and any subsequent
trigger programs that would have been executed are abandoned. No database
changes are rolled back. If the statement that caused the trigger program
to execute is itself part of a trigger program, then that trigger program
resumes execution at the beginning of the next step.
