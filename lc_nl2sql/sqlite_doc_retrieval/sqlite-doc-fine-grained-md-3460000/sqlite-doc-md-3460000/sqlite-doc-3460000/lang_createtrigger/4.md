# 3\. INSTEAD OF triggers


BEFORE and AFTER triggers work only on ordinary tables.
INSTEAD OF triggers work only on views.



If an INSTEAD OF INSERT trigger exists on a view, then it is
possible to execute an INSERT statement against that view. No actual
insert occurs. Instead, the statements contained within the trigger
are run. INSTEAD OF DELETE and
INSTEAD OF UPDATE triggers work the same way for DELETE and UPDATE statements
against views.


Note that the [sqlite3\_changes()](c3ref/changes.html) and [sqlite3\_total\_changes()](c3ref/total_changes.html) interfaces
do not count INSTEAD OF trigger firings, but the
[count\_changes pragma](pragma.html#pragma_count_changes) does count INSTEAD OF trigger firing.
