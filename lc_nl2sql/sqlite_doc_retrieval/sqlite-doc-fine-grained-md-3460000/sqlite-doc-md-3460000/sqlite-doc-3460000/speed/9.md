### Test 6: Creating an index



> CREATE INDEX i2a ON t2(a);  
> CREATE INDEX i2b ON t2(b);



| PostgreSQL: | 0\.381 |
| --- | --- |
| MySQL: | 0\.318 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6: | 0\.777 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6 (nosync): | 0\.659 |



SQLite is slower at creating new indices. This is not a huge problem
(since new indices are not created very often) but it is something that
is being worked on. Hopefully, future versions of SQLite will do better
here.
