### Executive Summary


A series of tests were run to measure the relative performance of
SQLite 2\.7\.6, PostgreSQL 7\.1\.3, and MySQL 3\.23\.41\.
The following are general
conclusions drawn from these experiments:



* SQLite 2\.7\.6 is significantly faster (sometimes as much as 10 or
 20 times faster) than the default PostgreSQL 7\.1\.3 installation
 on RedHat 7\.2 for most common operations.
* SQLite 2\.7\.6 is often faster (sometimes
 more than twice as fast) than MySQL 3\.23\.41
 for most common operations.
* SQLite does not execute CREATE INDEX or DROP TABLE as fast as
 the other databases. But this is not seen as a problem because
 those are infrequent operations.
* SQLite works best if you group multiple operations together into
 a single transaction.



The results presented here come with the following caveats:



* These tests did not attempt to measure multi\-user performance or
 optimization of complex queries involving multiple joins and subqueries.
* These tests are on a relatively small (approximately 14 megabyte) database.
 They do not measure how well the database engines scale to larger problems.
