### Test 14: A big INSERT after a big DELETE



> INSERT INTO t2 SELECT \* FROM t1;



| PostgreSQL: | 13\.168 |
| --- | --- |
| MySQL: | 1\.815 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6: | 3\.210 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6 (nosync): | 1\.485 |



Some older versions of SQLite (prior to version 2\.4\.0\)
would show decreasing performance after a
sequence of DELETEs followed by new INSERTs. As this test shows, the
problem has now been resolved.
