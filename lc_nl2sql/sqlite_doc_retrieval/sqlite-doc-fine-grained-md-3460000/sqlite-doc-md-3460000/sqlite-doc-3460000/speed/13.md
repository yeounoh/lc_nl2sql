### Test 10: 25000 text UPDATEs with an index

| PostgreSQL: | 48\.133 |
| --- | --- |
| MySQL: | 6\.982 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6: | 2\.408 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6 (nosync): | 1\.725 |



Here again, version 2\.7\.0 of SQLite used to run at about the same speed
as MySQL. But now version 2\.7\.6 is over two times faster than MySQL and
over twenty times faster than PostgreSQL.




In fairness to PostgreSQL, it started thrashing on this test. A
knowledgeable administrator might be able to get PostgreSQL to run a lot
faster here by tweaking and tuning the server a little.
