### Test 2: 25000 INSERTs in a transaction



> BEGIN;  
> 
> CREATE TABLE t2(a INTEGER, b INTEGER, c VARCHAR(100\));  
> 
> INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(1,59672,'fifty nine thousand six hundred seventy two');  
> 
> *... 24997 lines omitted*  
> 
> INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(24999,89569,'eighty nine thousand five hundred sixty nine');  
> 
> INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(25000,94666,'ninety four thousand six hundred sixty six');

| PostgreSQL: | 4\.900 |
| --- | --- |
| MySQL: | 2\.184 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6: | 0\.914 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6 (nosync): | 0\.757 |



When all the INSERTs are put in a transaction, SQLite no longer has to
close and reopen the database or invalidate its cache between each statement.
It also does not
have to do any fsync()s until the very end. When unshackled in
this way, SQLite is much faster than either PostgreSQL and MySQL.
