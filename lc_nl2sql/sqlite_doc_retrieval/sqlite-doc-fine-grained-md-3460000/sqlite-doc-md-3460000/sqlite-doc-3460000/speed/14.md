### Test 11: INSERTs from a SELECT



> BEGIN;  
> INSERT INTO t1 SELECT b,a,c FROM t2;  
> INSERT INTO t2 SELECT b,a,c FROM t1;  
> COMMIT;



| PostgreSQL: | 61\.364 |
| --- | --- |
| MySQL: | 1\.537 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6: | 2\.787 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6 (nosync): | 1\.599 |



The asynchronous SQLite is just a shade slower than MySQL on this test.
(MySQL seems to be especially adept at INSERT...SELECT statements.)
The PostgreSQL engine is still thrashing \- most of the 61 seconds it used
were spent waiting on disk I/O.
