### Test 8: 1000 UPDATEs without an index

| PostgreSQL: | 1\.739 |
| --- | --- |
| MySQL: | 8\.410 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6: | 0\.637 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6 (nosync): | 0\.638 |



For this particular UPDATE test, MySQL is consistently
five or ten times
slower than PostgreSQL and SQLite. I do not know why. MySQL is
normally a very fast engine. Perhaps this problem has been addressed
in later versions of MySQL.
