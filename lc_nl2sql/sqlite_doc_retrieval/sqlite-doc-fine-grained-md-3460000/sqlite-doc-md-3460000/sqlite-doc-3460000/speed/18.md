### Test 15: A big DELETE followed by many small INSERTs



> BEGIN;  
> 
> DELETE FROM t1;  
> 
> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1,10719,'ten thousand seven hundred nineteen');  
> 
> *... 11997 lines omitted*  
> 
> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(11999,72836,'seventy two thousand eight hundred thirty six');  
> 
> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(12000,64231,'sixty four thousand two hundred thirty one');  
> 
> COMMIT;



| PostgreSQL: | 4\.556 |
| --- | --- |
| MySQL: | 1\.704 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6: | 0\.618 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6 (nosync): | 0\.406 |



SQLite is very good at doing INSERTs within a transaction, which probably
explains why it is so much faster than the other databases at this test.
