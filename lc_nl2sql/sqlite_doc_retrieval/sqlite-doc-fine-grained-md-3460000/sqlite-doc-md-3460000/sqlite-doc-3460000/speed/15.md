### Test 12: DELETE without an index



> DELETE FROM t2 WHERE c LIKE '%fifty%';



| PostgreSQL: | 1\.509 |
| --- | --- |
| MySQL: | 0\.975 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6: | 4\.004 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6 (nosync): | 0\.560 |



The synchronous version of SQLite is the slowest of the group in this test,
but the asynchronous version is the fastest.
The difference is the extra time needed to execute fsync().
