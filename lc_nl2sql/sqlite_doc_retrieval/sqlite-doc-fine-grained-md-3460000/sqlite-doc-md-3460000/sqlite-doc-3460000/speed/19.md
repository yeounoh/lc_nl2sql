### Test 16: DROP TABLE



> DROP TABLE t1;  
> DROP TABLE t2;  
> DROP TABLE t3;



| PostgreSQL: | 0\.135 |
| --- | --- |
| MySQL: | 0\.015 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6: | 0\.939 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6 (nosync): | 0\.254 |



SQLite is slower than the other databases when it comes to dropping tables.
This probably is because when SQLite drops a table, it has to go through and
erase the records in the database file that deal with that table. MySQL and
PostgreSQL, on the other hand, use separate files to represent each table
so they can drop a table simply by deleting a file, which is much faster.




On the other hand, dropping tables is not a very common operation
so if SQLite takes a little longer, that is not seen as a big problem.
