### Test 13: DELETE with an index



> DELETE FROM t2 WHERE a\>10 AND a\<20000;



| PostgreSQL: | 1\.316 |
| --- | --- |
| MySQL: | 2\.262 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6: | 2\.068 |
| SQLite 2\.7\.6 (nosync): | 0\.752 |



This test is significant because it is one of the few where
PostgreSQL is faster than MySQL. The asynchronous SQLite is,
however, faster then both the other two.
