## 1\.1\. Syntax


To create a WITHOUT ROWID table, simply add the keywords "WITHOUT ROWID"
to the end of the [CREATE TABLE](lang_createtable.html) statement. For example:



> ```
> 
> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS wordcount(
>   word TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
>   cnt INTEGER
> ) WITHOUT ROWID;
> 
> ```


As with all SQL syntax, the case of the keywords does not matter.
One can write "WITHOUT rowid" or "without rowid" or "WiThOuT rOwId" and
it will mean the same thing.


Every WITHOUT ROWID table must have a [PRIMARY KEY](lang_createtable.html#primkeyconst). An error is raised
if a CREATE TABLE statement with the WITHOUT ROWID clause lacks a PRIMARY KEY.



In most contexts, the special "rowid" column of normal tables can
also be called "oid" or "\_rowid\_". However, only "rowid" works as
the keyword in the CREATE TABLE statement.
