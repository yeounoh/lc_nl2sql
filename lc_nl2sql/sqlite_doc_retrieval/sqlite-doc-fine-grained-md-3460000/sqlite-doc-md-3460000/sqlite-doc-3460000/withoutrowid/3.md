## 1\.2\. Compatibility


SQLite [version 3\.8\.2](releaselog/3_8_2.html) (2013\-12\-06\) or later
is necessary in order to use a WITHOUT
ROWID table. An attempt to open a database that contains one or more WITHOUT
ROWID tables using an earlier version of SQLite will result in a
"malformed database schema" error.
