## 1\.3\. Quirks


WITHOUT ROWID is found only in SQLite and is not compatible
with any other SQL database engine, as far as we know.
In an elegant system, all tables would behave as WITHOUT ROWID
tables even without the WITHOUT ROWID keyword. However, when SQLite was
first designed, it used only integer [rowids](lang_createtable.html#rowid) for row keys
to simplify the implementation.
This approach worked well for many years. But as the demands on
SQLite grew, the need for tables in which the PRIMARY KEY really did
correspond to the underlying row key grew more acute. The WITHOUT ROWID
concept was added
in order to meet that need without breaking backwards
compatibility with the billions of SQLite databases already in use at
the time (circa 2013\).
