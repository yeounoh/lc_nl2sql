# 1\. Introduction


By default, every row in SQLite has a special column, usually called the
"[rowid](lang_createtable.html#rowid)", that uniquely identifies that row within the table. However
if the phrase "WITHOUT ROWID" is added to the end of a [CREATE TABLE](lang_createtable.html) statement,
then the special "rowid" column is omitted. There are sometimes
space and performance advantages to omitting the rowid.


A WITHOUT ROWID table is a table that uses a
[Clustered Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index#Clustered)
as the primary key.
