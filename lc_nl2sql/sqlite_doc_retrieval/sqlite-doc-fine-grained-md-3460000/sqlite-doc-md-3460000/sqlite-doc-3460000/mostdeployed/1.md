## Most Widely Deployed and Used Database Engine


SQLite is likely used more than all other database engines
combined. Billions and billions of copies
of SQLite exist in the wild. SQLite is found in:

* Every Android device
* Every iPhone and iOS device
* Every Mac
* Every Windows10 machine
* Every Firefox, Chrome, and Safari web browser
* Every instance of Skype
* Every instance of iTunes
* Every Dropbox client
* Every TurboTax and QuickBooks
* PHP and Python
* Most television sets and set\-top cable boxes
* Most automotive multimedia systems
* Countless millions of other applications


Since SQLite is used extensively in every smartphone, and there are
more than 4\.0 billion (4\.0e9\) smartphones in active use, each holding
hundreds of
SQLite database files, it is seems likely that there are over one trillion
(1e12\) SQLite databases in active use.
