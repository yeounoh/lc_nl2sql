# 1\. Introduction



One of the [distinctive features](different.html) of
SQLite is that a database consists of a single disk file.
This simplifies the use of SQLite since moving or backing up a
database is a simple as copying a single file. It also makes
SQLite appropriate for use as an
[application file format](whentouse.html#appfileformat).
But while a complete database is held in a single disk file,
SQLite does make use of many temporary files during the
course of processing a database.




This article describes the various temporary files that SQLite
creates and uses. It describes when the files are created, when
they are deleted, what they are used for, why they are important,
and how to avoid them on systems where creating temporary files is
expensive.




The manner in which SQLite uses temporary files is not considered
part of the contract that SQLite makes with applications. The
information in this document is a correct description of how
SQLite operates at the time that this document was written or last
updated. But there is no guarantee that future versions of SQLite
will use temporary files in the same way. New kinds of temporary
files might be employed and some of
the current temporary file uses might be discontinued
in future releases of SQLite.
