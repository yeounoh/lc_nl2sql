## 2\.6\. TEMP Databases


Tables created using the "CREATE TEMP TABLE" syntax are only
visible to the [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html) in which the "CREATE TEMP TABLE"
statement is originally evaluated. These TEMP tables, together
with any associated indices, triggers, and views, are collectively
stored in a separate temporary database file that is created as
soon as the first "CREATE TEMP TABLE" statement is seen.
This separate temporary database file also has an associated
rollback journal.
The temporary database file used to store TEMP tables is deleted
automatically when the [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html) is closed
using [sqlite3\_close()](c3ref/close.html).




The TEMP database file is very similar to auxiliary database
files added using the [ATTACH](lang_attach.html) statement, though with a few
special properties.
The TEMP database is always automatically deleted when the
[database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html) is closed.
The TEMP database always uses the
[synchronous\=OFF](pragma.html#pragma_synchronous) and [journal\_mode\=PERSIST](pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode)
PRAGMA settings.
And, the TEMP database cannot be used with [DETACH](lang_detach.html) nor can
another process [ATTACH](lang_attach.html) the TEMP database.




The temporary files associated with the TEMP database and its
rollback journal are only created if the application makes use
of the "CREATE TEMP TABLE" statement.
