## 2\.9\. Transient Database Used By [VACUUM](lang_vacuum.html)



The [VACUUM](lang_vacuum.html) command works by creating a temporary file
and then rebuilding the entire database into that temporary
file. Then the content of the temporary file is copied back
into the original database file and the temporary file is
deleted.




The temporary file created by the [VACUUM](lang_vacuum.html) command exists only
for the duration of the command itself. The size of the temporary
file will be no larger than the original database.
