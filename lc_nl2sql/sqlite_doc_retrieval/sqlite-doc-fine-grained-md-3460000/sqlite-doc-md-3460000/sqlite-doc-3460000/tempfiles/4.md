## 2\.2\. Write\-Ahead Log (WAL) Files



A write\-ahead log or WAL file is used in place of a rollback journal
when SQLite is operating in [WAL mode](wal.html). As with the rollback journal,
the purpose of the WAL file is to implement atomic commit and rollback.
The WAL file is always located in the same directory
as the database file and has the same name as the database
file except with the 4 characters "**\-wal**" appended.
The WAL file is created when the first connection to the
database is opened and is normally removed when the last
connection to the database closes. However, if the last connection
does not shutdown cleanly, the WAL file will remain in the filesystem
and will be automatically cleaned up the next time the database is
opened.
