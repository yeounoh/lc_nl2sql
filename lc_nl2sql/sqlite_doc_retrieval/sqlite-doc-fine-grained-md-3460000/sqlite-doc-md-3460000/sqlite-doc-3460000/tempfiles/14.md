# 5\. Temporary File Storage Locations



The directory or folder in which temporary files are created is
determined by the OS\-specific [VFS](vfs.html).




On unix\-like systems, directories are searched in the following order:


1. The directory set by [PRAGMA temp\_store\_directory](pragma.html#pragma_temp_store_directory) or by the
 [sqlite3\_temp\_directory](c3ref/temp_directory.html) global variable
2. The SQLITE\_TMPDIR environment variable
3. The TMPDIR environment variable
4. /var/tmp
5. /usr/tmp
6. /tmp
7. The current working directory (".")


The first of the above that is found to exist and have the write and
execute bits set is used. The final "." fallback is important for some
applications that use SQLite inside of chroot jails that do not have
the standard temporary file locations available.


On Windows systems, folders are searched in the following order:


1. The folder set by [PRAGMA temp\_store\_directory](pragma.html#pragma_temp_store_directory) or by the
 [sqlite3\_temp\_directory](c3ref/temp_directory.html) global variable
2. The folder returned by the GetTempPath() system interface.


SQLite itself does not pay any attention to environment variables
in this case, though presumably the GetTempPath() system call does.
The search algorithm is different for CYGWIN builds. Check the 
source code for details.
