# 3\. Special\-case Processing For Date/Time Functions



The built\-in [date and time functions](lang_datefunc.html) of SQLite are a special case.
These functions are usually considered deterministic. However, if
these functions use the string "now" as the date, or if they use
the [localtime modifier](lang_datefunc.html#localtime) or the [utc modifier](lang_datefunc.html#localtime), then they are
considered non\-deterministic. Because the function inputs are
not necessarily known until run\-time, the date/time functions will
throw an exception if they encounter any of the non\-deterministic
features in a context where only deterministic functions are allowed.




Prior to SQLite 3\.20\.0 (2017\-08\-01\) all date/time functions were
always considered non\-deterministic. The ability for date/time functions
to be deterministic sometimes and non\-deterministic at other times,
depending on their arguments, was added for the 3\.20\.0 release.
