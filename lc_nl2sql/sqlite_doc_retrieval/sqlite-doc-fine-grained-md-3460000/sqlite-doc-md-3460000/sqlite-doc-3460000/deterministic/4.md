## 3\.1\. Bug fix in version 3\.35\.2



When the enhancement was made to SQLite 3\.20\.0 such that date/time
functions would be considered deterministic as they do not depend
on the current time, one case was overlooked:
Many of the date/time functions can be called
with no arguments at all. These no\-argument date/time functions
behave as if they had a single "'now'" argument.
Thus "datetime()" and
"datetime('now')" both yield the current date and time.
However, only the second form was recognized as non\-deterministic.
This meant that developers could sneak the non\-deterministic
"datetime()" form into CHECK constraints, index
expressions, generated column expressions, and similar places
where non\-deterministic functions make no sense.
This oversight was fixed in version 3\.35\.2 (2021\-03\-17\).
However, there may be legacy databases in circulation that were created
by SQLite version 3\.20\.0 through 3\.35\.1 that have non\-deterministic
date/time functions in their schemas.
