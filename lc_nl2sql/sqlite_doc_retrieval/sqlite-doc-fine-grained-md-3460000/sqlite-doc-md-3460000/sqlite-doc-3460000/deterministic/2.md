# 2\. Restrictions on the use of non\-deterministic functions



There are some contexts in SQLite that do not allow the use of
non\-deterministic functions:



* In the expression of a [CHECK constraint](lang_createtable.html#ckconst).
* In the WHERE clause of a [partial index](partialindex.html).
* In an expression used as part of an [expression index](expridx.html).
* In the expression of a [generated column](gencol.html).



In the cases above, the values returned by the function affects the
information stored in the database file. The values of functions
in CHECK constraints determines which entries are valid for a table,
and functions in the WHERE clause of a partial index or in an index on
an expression compute values stored in the index b\-tree.
If any of these functions later returns a different
value, then the database might no longer be well\-formed. 
Hence, to avoid database corruption,
only deterministic functions can be used in the contexts
above.
