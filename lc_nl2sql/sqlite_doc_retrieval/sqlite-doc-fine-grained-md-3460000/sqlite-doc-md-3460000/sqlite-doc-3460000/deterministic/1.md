# 1\. Overview



SQL functions in SQLite can be either "deterministic" or "non\-deterministic".




A deterministic function always gives the same answer when it has
the same inputs. Most built\-in SQL functions in SQLite are
deterministic. For example, the [abs(X)](lang_corefunc.html#abs) function always returns
the same answer as long as its input X is the same.




Non\-deterministic functions might give different answers on each
invocation, even if the arguments are always the same. The following
are examples of non\-deterministic functions:



* [random()](lang_corefunc.html#random)
* [changes()](lang_corefunc.html#changes)
* [last\_insert\_rowid()](lang_corefunc.html#last_insert_rowid)
* [sqlite3\_version()](c3ref/libversion.html)



The [random()](lang_corefunc.html#random) function is obviously non\-deterministic because it gives
a different answer every time it is invoked. The answers from [changes()](lang_corefunc.html#changes)
and [last\_insert\_rowid()](lang_corefunc.html#last_insert_rowid) depend on prior SQL statements, and so they
are also non\-deterministic. The
[sqlite3\_version()](c3ref/libversion.html) function is mostly constant, but it can change when
SQLite is upgraded, and so even though it always returns the same answer
for any particular session, because it can change answers across sessions
it is still considered non\-deterministic.
