## A Template For SELECT Programs


The first two query examples illustrate a kind of template that
every SELECT program will follow. Basically, we have:



1. Initialize the **azColumnName\[]** array for the callback.
2. Open a cursor into the table to be queried.
3. For each record in the table, do:
	1. If the WHERE clause evaluates to FALSE, then skip the steps that
	 follow and continue to the next record.
	2. Compute all columns for the current row of the result.
	3. Invoke the callback function for the current row of the result.- Close the cursor.





This template will be expanded considerably as we consider
additional complications such as joins, compound selects, using
indices to speed the search, sorting, and aggregate functions
with and without GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.
But the same basic ideas will continue to apply.
