## Proprietary SQLite Extensions


The core SQLite library found on this website is in the
[public domain](copyright.html). But there also exist
proprietary, licensed extensions to SQLite.


* The [SQLite Encryption Extension (SEE)](https://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/see.html)
will read and write database files encrypted using
128\-bit or 256\-bit AES.
* The [SQLite Compressed and Encrypted Read\-Only Database (CEROD)](https://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/cerod.html)
extension will read a database file that is both compressed
and encrypted.
* The [ZIPVFS](https://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/zipvfs.html)
extension will both read and write database files that are both compressed and optionally
encrypted using application\-supplied compression and encryption routines.
* The [Test Harness \#3 (TH3\)](th3.html) is an alternative set of test
vectors for SQLite that verify the operation of SQLite in an
as\-deployed configuration on embedded platforms with
[100% branch test coverage](testing.html#coverage).
