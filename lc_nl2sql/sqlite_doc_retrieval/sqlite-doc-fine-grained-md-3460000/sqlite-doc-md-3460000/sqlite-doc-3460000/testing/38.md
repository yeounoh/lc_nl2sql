## 8\.2\. Valgrind


[Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) is perhaps the most amazing
and useful developer tool in the world. Valgrind is a simulator \- it simulates
an x86 running a Linux binary. (Ports of Valgrind for platforms other
than Linux are in development, but as of this writing, Valgrind only
works reliably on Linux, which in the opinion of the SQLite developers
means that Linux should be the preferred platform for all software development.)
As Valgrind runs a Linux binary, it looks for all kinds of interesting
errors such as array overruns, reading from uninitialized memory,
stack overflows, memory leaks, and so forth. Valgrind finds problems
that can easily slip through all of the other tests run against SQLite.
And, when Valgrind does find an error, it can dump the developer directly
into a symbolic debugger at the exact point where the error occur, to
facilitate a quick fix.


Because it is a simulator, running a binary in Valgrind is slower than
running it on native hardware. (To a first approximation, an application
running in Valgrind on a workstation will perform about the same as it
would running natively on a smartphone.) So it is impractical to run the full
SQLite test suite through Valgrind. However, the veryquick tests and
the coverage of the TH3 tests are run through Valgrind prior to every
release.
