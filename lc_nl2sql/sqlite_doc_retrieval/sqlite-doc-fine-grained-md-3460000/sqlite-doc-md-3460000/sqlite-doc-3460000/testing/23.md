## 7\.2\. Coverage testing of defensive code


A well\-written C program will typically contain some defensive
conditionals which in practice are always true or always false.
This leads to a
programming dilemma: Does one remove defensive code in order to obtain
100% branch coverage?


In SQLite, the answer to the previous question is "no".
For testing purposes, the SQLite source code defines
macros called ALWAYS() and NEVER(). The ALWAYS() macro
surrounds conditions
which are expected to always evaluate as true and NEVER() surrounds
conditions that are always evaluated to false. These macros serve as
comments to indicate that the conditions are defensive code.
In release builds, these macros are pass\-throughs:
