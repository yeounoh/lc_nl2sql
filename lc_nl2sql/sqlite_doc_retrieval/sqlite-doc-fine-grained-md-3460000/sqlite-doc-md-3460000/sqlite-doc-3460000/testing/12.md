### 4\.1\.2\. Google OSS Fuzz


Beginning in 2016, a team of engineers at Google started the
[OSS Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) project.
OSS Fuzz uses a AFL\-style guided fuzzer running on Google's infrastructure.
The Fuzzer automatically downloads the latest check\-ins for participating
projects, fuzzes them, and sends email to the developers reporting any
problems. When a fix is checked in, the fuzzer automatically detects this
and emails a confirmation to the developers.



SQLite is one of many open\-source projects that OSS Fuzz tests. The
[test/ossfuzz.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/test/ossfuzz.c) source file
in the SQLite repository is SQLite's interface to OSS fuzz.



OSS Fuzz no longer finds historical bugs in SQLite. But it is still
running and does occasionally find issues in new development check\-ins.
