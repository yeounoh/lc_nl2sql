## 7\.4\. Branch coverage versus MC/DC


Two methods of measuring test coverage were described above:
"statement" and "branch" coverage. There are many other test coverage
metrics besides these two. Another popular metric is "Modified
Condition/Decision Coverage" or MC/DC.
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Condition/Decision_Coverage)
defines MC/DC as follows:


* Each decision tries every possible outcome.
* Each condition in a decision takes on every possible outcome.
* Each entry and exit point is invoked.
* Each condition in a decision is shown to independently
 affect the outcome of the decision.


In the C programming language
where **\&\&** and **\|\|**
are "short\-circuit" operators, MC/DC and branch coverage are very nearly
the same thing. The primary difference is in boolean vector tests.
One can test for any of several bits in bit\-vector and still obtain
100% branch test coverage even though the second element of MC/DC \- the
requirement that each condition in a decision take on every possible outcome \-
might not be satisfied.


SQLite uses testcase() macros as described in the previous
subsection to make sure that every condition in a bit\-vector decision takes
on every possible outcome. In this way, SQLite also achieves 100% MC/DC
in addition to 100% branch coverage.
