#define NEVER(X)   (0)

```

The test suite is designed to be run three times, once for each of
the ALWAYS() and NEVER() definitions shown above. All three test runs
should yield exactly the same result. There is a run\-time test using
the [sqlite3\_test\_control](c3ref/test_control.html)([SQLITE\_TESTCTRL\_ALWAYS](c3ref/c_testctrl_always.html), ...) interface that
can be used to verify that the macros are correctly set to the first
form (the pass\-through form) for deployment.
