## 8\.1\. Assert


The SQLite core contains 6754 assert()
statements that verify function preconditions and postconditions and
loop invariants. Assert() is a macro which is a standard part of
ANSI\-C. The argument is a boolean value that is assumed to always be
true. If the assertion is false, the program prints an error message
and halts.


Assert() macros are disabled by compiling with the NDEBUG macro defined.
In most systems, asserts are enabled by default. But in SQLite, the
asserts are so numerous and are in such performance critical places, that
the database engine runs about three times slower when asserts are enabled.
Hence, the default (production) build of SQLite disables asserts.
Assert statements are only enabled when SQLite is compiled with the
SQLITE\_DEBUG preprocessor macro defined.


See the [Use Of assert in SQLite](assert.html) document
for additional information about how SQLite uses assert().
