### 4\.1\.5\. The fuzzcheck test harness


Historical test cases from [AFL](testing.html#aflfuzz), [OSS Fuzz](testing.html#ossfuzz), and [dbsqlfuzz](testing.html#dbsqlfuzz) are
collected in a set of database files in the main SQLite source tree
and then rerun by the "fuzzcheck" utility program whenever one runs
"make test". Fuzzcheck only runs a few thousand "interesting" cases
out of the billions of cases that the various fuzzers have
examined over the years. "Interesting" cases are cases that exhibit
previously unseen behavior. Actual bugs found by fuzzers are always
included among the interesting test cases, but most of the cases run
by fuzzcheck were never actual bugs.
