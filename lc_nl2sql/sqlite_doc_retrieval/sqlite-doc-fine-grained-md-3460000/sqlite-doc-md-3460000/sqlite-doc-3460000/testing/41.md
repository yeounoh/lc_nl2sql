## 8\.5\. Journal Tests


One of the things that SQLite does to ensure that transactions
are atomic across system crashes and power failures is to write
all changes into the rollback journal file prior to changing the
database. The TCL test harness contains an alternative
[OS backend](vfs.html) implementation that helps to
verify this is occurring correctly. The "journal\-test VFS" monitors
all disk I/O traffic between the database file and rollback journal,
checking to make sure that nothing is written into the database
file which has not first been written and synced to the rollback journal.
If any discrepancies are found, an assertion fault is raised.


The journal tests are an additional double\-check over and above
the crash tests to make sure that SQLite transactions will be atomic
across system crashes and power failures.
