## 8\.4\. Mutex Asserts


SQLite contains a pluggable mutex subsystem. Depending on
compile\-time options, the default mutex system contains interfaces
[sqlite3\_mutex\_held()](c3ref/mutex_held.html) and [sqlite3\_mutex\_notheld()](c3ref/mutex_held.html) that detect
whether or not a particular mutex is held by the calling thread.
These two interfaces are used extensively within assert() statements
in SQLite to verify mutexes are held and released at all the right
moments, in order to double\-check that SQLite does work correctly
in multi\-threaded applications.
