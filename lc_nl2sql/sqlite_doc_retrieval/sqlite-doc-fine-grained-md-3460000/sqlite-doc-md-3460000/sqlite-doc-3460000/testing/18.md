## 4\.3\. Boundary Value Tests


SQLite defines certain [limits](limits.html) on its operation, such as the
maximum number of columns in a table, the maximum length of an
SQL statement, or the maximum value of an integer. The TCL and TH3 test
suites both contains numerous tests that push SQLite right to the edge
of its defined limits and verify that it performs correctly for
all allowed values. Additional tests go beyond the defined limits
and verify that SQLite correctly returns errors. The source code
contains [testcase macros](testing.html#testcase) to verify that both sides of each boundary
have been tested.
