# 3\. Anomaly Testing


Anomaly tests are tests designed to verify the correct behavior
of SQLite when something goes wrong. It is (relatively) easy to build
an SQL database engine that behaves correctly on well\-formed inputs
on a fully functional computer. It is more difficult to build a system
that responds sanely to invalid inputs and continues to function following
system malfunctions. The anomaly tests are designed to verify the latter
behavior.
