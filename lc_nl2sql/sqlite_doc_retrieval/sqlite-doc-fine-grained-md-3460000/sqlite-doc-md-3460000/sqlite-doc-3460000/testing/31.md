#define testcase(X)

```

But in a coverage measuring build, the testcase() macro
generates code that evaluates the conditional expression in its argument.
Then during analysis, a check
is made to ensure tests exist that evaluate the conditional to both true
and false. Testcase() macros are used, for example, to help verify
that boundary values are tested. For example:



```
testcase( a==b );
testcase( a==b+1 );
if( a>b && c!=25 ){ d++; }

```

Testcase macros are also used when two or more cases of a switch
statement go to the same block of code, to make sure that the code was
reached for all cases:



```
switch( op ){
  case OP_Add:
  case OP_Subtract: {
    testcase( op==OP_Add );
    testcase( op==OP_Subtract );
    /* ... */
    break;
  }
  /* ... */
}

```

For bitmask tests, testcase() macros are used to verify that every
bit of the bitmask affects the outcome. For example, in the following block
of code, the condition is true if the mask contains either of two bits
indicating either a MAIN\_DB or a TEMP\_DB is being opened.
The testcase()
macros that precede the if statement verify that both cases are tested:



```
testcase( mask & SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB );
testcase( mask & SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB );
if( (mask & (SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB|SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB))!=0 ){ ... }

```

The SQLite source code contains 1184
uses of the testcase() macro.
