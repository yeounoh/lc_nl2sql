# 1\. Introduction


The reliability and robustness of SQLite is achieved in part
by thorough and careful testing.


As of [version 3\.42\.0](releaselog/3_42_0.html) (2023\-05\-16\),
the SQLite library consists of approximately
155\.8 KSLOC of C code.
(KSLOC means thousands of "Source Lines Of Code" or, in other words,
lines of code excluding blank lines and comments.)
By comparison, the project has
590 times as much
test code and test scripts \-
92053\.1 KSLOC.
