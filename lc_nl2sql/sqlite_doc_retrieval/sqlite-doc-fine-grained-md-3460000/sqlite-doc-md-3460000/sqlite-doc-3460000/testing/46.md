# 12\. Summary


SQLite is open source. This gives many people the idea that
it is not well tested as commercial software and is perhaps unreliable.
But that impression is false.
SQLite has exhibited very high reliability in the field and
a very low defect rate, especially considering how rapidly it is evolving.
The quality of SQLite is achieved in part by careful code design and
implementation. But extensive testing also plays a vital role in
maintaining and improving the quality of SQLite. This document has
summarized the testing procedures that every release of SQLite undergoes
with the hope of inspiring confidence that SQLite is
suitable for use in mission\-critical applications.
