# 5\. Regression Testing


Whenever a bug is reported against SQLite, that bug is not considered
fixed until new test cases that would exhibit the bug have been added
to either the TCL or TH3 test suites.
Over the years,
this has resulted in thousands and thousands of new tests.
These regression tests ensure that bugs that have
been fixed in the past are not reintroduced into future versions of
SQLite.
