## 4\.1\. SQL Fuzz


SQL fuzz testing consists of creating syntactically correct yet
wildly nonsensical SQL statements and feeding them to SQLite to see
what it will do with them. Usually some kind of error is returned
(such as "no such table"). Sometimes, purely by chance, the SQL
statement also happens to be semantically correct. In that case, the
resulting prepared statement is run to make sure it gives a reasonable
result.
