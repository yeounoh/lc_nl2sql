# 6\. Automatic Resource Leak Detection


Resource leak occurs when system resources
are allocated and never freed. The most troublesome resource leaks
in many applications are memory leaks \- when memory is allocated using
malloc() but never released using free(). But other kinds of resources
can also be leaked: file descriptors, threads, mutexes, etc.


Both the TCL and TH3 test harnesses automatically track system
resources and report resource leaks on every test run.
No special configuration or setup is required. The test harnesses
are especially vigilant with regard to memory leaks. If a change
causes a memory leak, the test harnesses will recognize this
quickly. SQLite is designed to never leak memory, even after
an exception such as an OOM error or disk I/O error. The test
harnesses are zealous to enforce this.
