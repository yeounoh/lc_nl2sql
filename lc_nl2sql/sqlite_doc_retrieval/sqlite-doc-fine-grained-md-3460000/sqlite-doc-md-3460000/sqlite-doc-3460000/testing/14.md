### 4\.1\.4\. Other third\-party fuzzers


SQLite seems to be a popular target for third\-parties to fuzz.
The developers hear about many attempts to fuzz SQLite
and they do occasionally get bug reports found by independent
fuzzers. All such reports are promptly fixed, so the product is
improved and that the entire SQLite user community benefits.
This mechanism of having many independent testers is similar to
[Linus's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law):
"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".



One fuzzing researcher of particular note is
[Manuel Rigger](https://www.manuelrigger.at/).
Most fuzzers only look for assertion faults, crashes, undefined behavior (UB),
or other easily detected anomalies. Dr. Rigger's fuzzers, on the other hand,
are able to find cases where SQLite computes an incorrect answer.
Rigger has found
[many such cases](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline?y=t&u=mrigger&n=all).
Most of these finds are obscure corner cases involving type
conversions and affinity transformations, and a good number of the finds
are against unreleased features. Nevertheless, his finds are still important
as they are real bugs,
and the SQLite developers are grateful to be able to identify and fix
the underlying problems.
