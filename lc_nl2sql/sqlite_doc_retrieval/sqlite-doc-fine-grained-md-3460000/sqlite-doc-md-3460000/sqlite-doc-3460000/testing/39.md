## 8\.3\. Memsys2


SQLite contains a pluggable
[memory allocation subsystem](malloc.html).
The default implementation uses system malloc() and free().
However, if SQLite is compiled with [SQLITE\_MEMDEBUG](compile.html#memdebug), an alternative
memory allocation wrapper ([memsys2](malloc.html#memdebug))
is inserted that looks for memory allocation
errors at run\-time. The memsys2 wrapper checks for memory leaks, of
course, but also looks for buffer overruns, uses of uninitialized memory,
and attempts to use memory after it has been freed. These same checks
are also done by valgrind (and, indeed, Valgrind does them better)
but memsys2 has the advantage of being much faster than Valgrind, which
means the checks can be done more often and for longer tests.
