## 7\.7\. Experience with full test coverage


The developers of SQLite have found that full coverage testing is an
extremely effective method for locating and preventing bugs.
Because every single branch
instruction in SQLite core code is covered by test cases, the developers
can be confident that changes made in one part of the code
do not have unintended consequences in other parts of the code.
The many new features and performance improvements that have been
added to SQLite in recent years would not have been possible without
the availability of full\-coverage testing.


Maintaining 100% MC/DC is laborious and time\-consuming.
The level of effort needed to maintain full\-coverage testing
is probably not cost effective for a typical application.
However, we think that full\-coverage testing is justified for a
[very widely deployed](mostdeployed.html) infrastructure library
like SQLite, and especially for a database library which by its very
nature "remembers" past mistakes.
