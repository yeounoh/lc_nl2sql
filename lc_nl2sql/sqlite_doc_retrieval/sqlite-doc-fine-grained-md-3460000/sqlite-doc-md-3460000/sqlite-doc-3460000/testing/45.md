# 11\. Static Analysis


Static analysis means analyzing source code at compile\-time to
check for correctness. Static analysis includes compiler
warning messages and more in\-depth analysis engines such as the
[Clang Static Analyzer](http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/).
SQLite compiles without warnings on GCC and Clang using
the \-Wall and \-Wextra flags on Linux and Mac and on MSVC on Windows.
No valid warnings are generated by the Clang Static Analyzer tool "scan\-build"
either (though recent versions of clang seem to generate many false\-positives.)
Nevertheless, some warnings might be generated by other
static analyzers. Users are encouraged not to stress over these
warnings and to instead take solace in the intense testing of SQLite
described above.



Static analysis has not been helpful in finding
bugs in SQLite. Static analysis has found a few bugs in SQLite, but
those are the exceptions. More bugs have been
introduced into SQLite while trying to get it to compile without
warnings than have been found by static analysis.
