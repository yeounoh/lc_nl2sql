# 1\. The sqlite3\_analyzer.exe Utility Program



The sqlite3\_analyzer.exe binary is a command\-line utility program
that measures and displays how much and how efficiently space is used by 
individual tables and indexes with an SQLite database file.
Example usage:




> ```
> 
> sqlite3_analyzer database.sqlite
> 
> ```



The output is a human\-readable ASCII text report that provides information
on the space utilization of the database file. The report is intended to
be self\-explanatory, though there is some 
[additional explanation](sqlanalyze.html#defs) of the
various parameters reported toward the end of the report.




The output is also valid SQL. Most of the report text is contained within
a header comment, with various SQL statements that create and initialize
a database at the
[end of the report](sqlanalyze.html#sqlx). The constructed database contains
the raw data from which the report was extracted. Hence the original
report can be read into an instance of the [command\-line shell](cli.html) and then
the raw data can be queried to dig deeper into the space utilization of
a particular database file.
