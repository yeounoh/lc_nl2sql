## 4\.1\. Auxiliary Columns



Beginning with SQLite version 3\.24\.0 (2018\-06\-04\), r\-tree tables
can have auxiliary columns that store arbitrary data.
Auxiliary columns can be used in place of
secondary tables such as "demo\_data".




Auxiliary columns are marked with a "\+" symbol before the column name.
Auxiliary columns must come after all of the coordinate boundary columns.
An RTREE table can have no more than 100 columns total. In other words,
the count of columns including the integer primary key column,
the coordinate boundary columns, and all auxiliary columns must be 100 or less.
The following example shows an r\-tree table with auxiliary columns that
is equivalent to the two tables "demo\_index" and "demo\_data" above:




```
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE demo_index2 USING rtree(
   id,              -- Integer primary key
   minX, maxX,      -- Minimum and maximum X coordinate
   minY, maxY,      -- Minimum and maximum Y coordinate
   +objname TEXT,   -- name of the object
   +objtype TEXT,   -- object type
   +boundary BLOB   -- detailed boundary of object
);

```


By combining location data and related information into the same
table, auxiliary columns can provide a cleaner model
and reduce the need to joins.
For example, the earlier
[join between demo\_index and demo\_data](#diquery) can now
be written as a simple query, like this:




```
SELECT objname FROM demo_index2
 WHERE contained_in(boundary, 35.37785, -80.77470)
   AND minX<=-80.77470 AND maxX>=-80.77470
   AND minY<=35.37785  AND maxY>=35.37785;

```
