### 3\.1\.1\. Column naming details



In the argments to "rtree" in the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement, the
names of the columns are taken from the first token of each argument.
All subsequent tokens within each argument are silently ignored.
This means, for example, that if you try to give a column a
[type affinity](datatype3.html#affinity) or add a constraint such as UNIQUE or NOT NULL or DEFAULT to
a column, those extra tokens are accepted as valid, but they do not change
the behavior of the rtree.
In an RTREE virtual table, the first column always has a
[type affinity](datatype3.html#affinity) of INTEGER and all other data columns have a
[type affinity](datatype3.html#affinity) of REAL.
In an RTREE\_I32 virtual table, all columns have type affinity of INTEGER.




Recommended practice is to omit any extra tokens in the rtree specification.
Let each argument to "rtree" be a single ordinary label that is the name of
the corresponding column, and omit all other tokens from the argument list.
