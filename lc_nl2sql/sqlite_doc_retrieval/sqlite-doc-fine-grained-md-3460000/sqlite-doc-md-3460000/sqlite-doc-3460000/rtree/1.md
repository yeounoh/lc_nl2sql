# 1\. Overview



An [R\-Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree) is a special
index that is designed for doing range queries. R\-Trees are most commonly
used in geospatial systems where each entry is a rectangle with minimum and
maximum X and Y coordinates. Given a query rectangle, an R\-Tree is able
to quickly find all entries that are contained within the query rectangle
or which overlap the query rectangle. This idea is easily extended to
three dimensions for use in CAD systems. R\-Trees also find use in time\-domain
range look\-ups. For example, suppose a database records the starting and
ending times for a large number of events. A R\-Tree is able to quickly
find all events that were active at any time during a given
time interval, or all events that started during a particular time interval,
or all events that both started and ended within a given time interval.
And so forth.




The R\-Tree concept originated with
[Toni Guttman](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-35973-1_1151):
*R\-Trees: A Dynamic Index Structure for Spatial Searching*,
Proc. 1984 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,
pp. 47\-57\.
The implementation found in SQLite is a refinement of Guttman's original
idea, commonly called "R\*Trees", that was described by
Norbert Beckmann, Hans\-Peter Kriegel, Ralf Schneider, Bernhard Seeger:
*The R\*\-Tree: An Efficient and Robust Access Method for Points
and Rectangles.* SIGMOD Conference 1990: 322\-331\.
