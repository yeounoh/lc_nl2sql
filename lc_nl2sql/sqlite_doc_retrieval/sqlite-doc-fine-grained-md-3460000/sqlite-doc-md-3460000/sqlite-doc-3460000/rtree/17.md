## 6\.3\. Additional Considerations for Custom Queries



The MATCH operator of a custom R\*Tree query function must be a top\-level
AND\-connected term of the WHERE clause, or else it will not be usable
by the R\*Tree query optimizer and the query will not be runnable.
If the MATCH operator is connected to other terms of the WHERE clause
via an OR operator, for example, the query will fail with an error.




Two or more MATCH operators are allowed in the same WHERE clause, as long
as they are connected by AND operators. However,
the R\*Tree query engine only contains a single priority queue. The priority
assigned to each node in the search is the lowest priority returned by any
of the MATCH operators.
