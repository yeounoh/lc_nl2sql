### 4\.1\.1\. Limitations



For auxiliary columns, only the name of the column matters.
The [type affinity](datatype3.html#affinity) is ignored.
Constraints such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, REFERENCES, or CHECK
are also ignored. However, future versions
of SQLite might start paying attention to the type affinity and
constraints, so users of auxiliary columns are advised to leave
both blank, to avoid future compatibility problems.
