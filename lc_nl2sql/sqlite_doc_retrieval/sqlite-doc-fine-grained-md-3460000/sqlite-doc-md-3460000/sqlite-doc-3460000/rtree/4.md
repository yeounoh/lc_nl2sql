## 3\.1\. Creating An R\*Tree Index



A new R\*Tree index is created as follows:




```
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE <name> USING rtree(<column-names>);

```


The *\<name\>* is the name your application chooses for the
R\*Tree index and *\<column\-names\>* is a comma separated list
of between 3 and 11 columns.
The virtual \<name\> table creates three [shadow tables](vtab.html#xshadowname) to actually
store its content. The names of these shadow tables are:




```
<name>_node  

<name>_rowid  

<name>_parent

```


The shadow tables are ordinary SQLite data tables. You can query them
directly if you like, though this unlikely to reveal anything particularly
useful.
And you can [UPDATE](lang_update.html), [DELETE](lang_delete.html), [INSERT](lang_insert.html) or even [DROP](lang_droptable.html)
the shadow tables, though doing so will corrupt your R\*Tree index.
So it is best to simply ignore the shadow tables. Recognize that they
hold your R\*Tree index information and let it go as that.




As an example, consider creating a two\-dimensional R\*Tree index for use in
spatial queries:




```
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE demo_index USING rtree(
   id,              -- Integer primary key
   minX, maxX,      -- Minimum and maximum X coordinate
   minY, maxY       -- Minimum and maximum Y coordinate
);

```
