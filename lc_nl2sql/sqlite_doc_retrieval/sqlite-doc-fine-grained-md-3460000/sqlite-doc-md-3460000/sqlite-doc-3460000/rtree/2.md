# 2\. Compiling The R\*Tree Module



The source code to the SQLite R\*Tree module is included as part
of the [amalgamation](amalgamation.html). However, depending on configuration options
and the particular version of SQLite you are using, it may or may not
be enabled by default. To ensure that the R\*Tree module is enabled,
simply compile with the [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_RTREE](compile.html#enable_rtree) 
C\-preprocessor macro defined. With many compilers, this is accomplished
by adding the option "\-DSQLITE\_ENABLE\_RTREE\=1" to the compiler
command\-line.
