## 1\.1\. Equivalent Recursive Common Table Expression


The generate\_series table can be simulated for positive step values
using a [recursive common table expression](lang_with.html#recursivecte). If the three parameters
are $start, $end, and $step, then the equivalent common table
expression is:




```
WITH RECURSIVE generate_series(value) AS (
  SELECT $start
  UNION ALL
  SELECT value+$step FROM generate_series
   WHERE value+$step<=$end
) ...

```

The common table expression works without having to load an
extension. On the other hand, the extension is easier to program
and faster.
