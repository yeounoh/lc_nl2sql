# 1\. Overview


The generate\_series(START,STOP,STEP) [table\-valued function](vtab.html#tabfunc2) is a
[loadable extension](loadext.html) included in the SQLite source tree, and compiled into
the [command\-line shell](cli.html). The generate\_series() table has one visible
result column named "value" holding integer values
and a number of rows determined by the
parameters START, STOP, and STEP. The first row of the table has
a value of START. Subsequent rows increment by STEP to a value
not exceeding STOP.



The generate\_series() table has additional, hidden columns
named "start", "stop", and "step" whose values are the effective
values of START, STOP and STEP as provided or defaulted.
It also has a rowid, accessible by its usual names.



Omitted parameters take on default values. STEP defaults to 1\.
STOP defaults to 4294967295\. The START parameter is required
as of version 3\.37\.0 (2021\-11\-27\) and later and an error will
be raised if START is omitted or has a self\-referential or otherwise
uncomputable value. Older versions used a default of 0 for START.
The legacy behavior can be obtained from recent code by compiling
with \-DZERO\_ARGUMENT\_GENERATE\_SERIES.
