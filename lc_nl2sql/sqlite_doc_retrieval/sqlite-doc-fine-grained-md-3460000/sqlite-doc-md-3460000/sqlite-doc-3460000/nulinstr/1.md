# 1\. Introduction



SQLite allows NUL characters (ASCII 0x00, Unicode \\u0000\) in the middle
of string values stored in the database. However, the use of NUL within
strings can lead to surprising behaviors:



1. The [length() SQL function](lang_corefunc.html#length) only counts characters up to and excluding
the first NUL.
2. The [quote() SQL function](lang_corefunc.html#quote) only shows characters up to and excluding
the first NUL.
3. The [.dump](cli.html#dump) command in the [CLI](cli.html) omits the first NUL character and all
subsequent text in the SQL output that it generates. In fact, the
[CLI](cli.html) omits everything past the first NUL character in all contexts.



The use of NUL characters in SQL text strings is not recommended.
