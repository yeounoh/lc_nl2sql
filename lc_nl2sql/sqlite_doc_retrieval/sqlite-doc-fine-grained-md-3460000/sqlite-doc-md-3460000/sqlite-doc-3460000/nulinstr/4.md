# 4\. Removing NUL Characters From A Text Field



The following example shows how to remove NUL character, and all text
that follows, from a column of a table. So if you have a database file
that contains embedded NULs and you would like to remove them, running
UPDATE statements similar to the following might help:




```
UPDATE t1 SET b=substr(b,1,instr(b,char(0)))
 WHERE instr(b,char(0));

```
