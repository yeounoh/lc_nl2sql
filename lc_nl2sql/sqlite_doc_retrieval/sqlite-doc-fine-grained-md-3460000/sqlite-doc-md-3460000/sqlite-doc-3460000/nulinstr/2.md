# 2\. Unexpected Behavior



Consider the following SQL:




```
CREATE TABLE t1(
  a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  b TEXT
);
INSERT INTO t1(a,b) VALUES(1, 'abc'||char(0)||'xyz');

SELECT a, b, length(b) FROM t1;

```


The SELECT statement above shows output of:




```
1,'abc',3

```


(Through this document, we assume that the [CLI](cli.html) has "[.mode quote](cli.html#dotmodequote)" set.)
But if you run:




```
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE b='abc';

```


Then no rows are returned. SQLite knows that the t1\.b column actually
holds a 7\-character string, and the 7\-character string 'abc'\|\|char(0\)\|\|'xyz'
is not equal to the 3\-character string 'abc', and so no rows are returned.
But a user might be easily confused by this because the [CLI](cli.html) output
seems to show that the string has only 3 characters. This seems like
a bug. But it is how SQLite works.
