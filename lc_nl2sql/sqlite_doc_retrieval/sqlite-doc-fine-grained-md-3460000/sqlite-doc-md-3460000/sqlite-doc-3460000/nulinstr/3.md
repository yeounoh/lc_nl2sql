# 3\. How To Tell If You Have NUL Characters In Your Strings



If you [CAST](lang_expr.html#castexpr) a string into a BLOB, then the entire length of the
string is shown. For example:




```
SELECT a, CAST(b AS BLOB) FROM t1;

```


Gives this result:




```
1,X'6162630078797a'

```


In the BLOB output, you can clearly see the NUL character as the 4th
character in the 7\-character string.




Another, more automated, way
to tell if a string value X contains embedded NUL characters is to
use an expression like this:




```
instr(X,char(0))

```


If this expression returns a non\-zero value N, then there exists an 
embedded NUL at the N\-th character position. Thus to count the number
of rows that contain embedded NUL characters:




```
SELECT count(*) FROM t1 WHERE instr(b,char(0))>0;

```
