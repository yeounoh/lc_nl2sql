### 2022\-01\-06 \- [Version 3\.37\.2](releaselog/3_37_2.html)


> Version 3\.37\.2 fixes a
> [database corruption bug](howtocorrupt.html#svptbug). You are
> encouraged to upgrade, especially if you are using [SAVEPOINT](lang_savepoint.html).
> The problem first appeared in version 3\.35\.0 (2021\-03\-12\) and
> affects all subsequent releases through 3\.37\.1\.
> If temporary files are store in memory (which is not the default
> behavior, but is sometimes selected by applications using either
> [\-DSQLITE\_TEMP\_STORE](compile.html#temp_store) or [PRAGMA temp\_store](pragma.html#pragma_temp_store)) and
> if a [SAVEPOINT](lang_savepoint.html) is rolled back and then subsequent changes
> within the same transaction are committed, the database file might
> (with low but non\-zero probability) go corrupt.
