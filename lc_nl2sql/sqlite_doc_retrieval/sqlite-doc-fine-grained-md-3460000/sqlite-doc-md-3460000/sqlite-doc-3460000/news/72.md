### 2017\-05\-24 \- Release 3\.19\.1


> One of the new query planner optimizations in the 3\.19\.0 release contained
> bugs. The 3\.19\.1 patch release fixes them.
> 
> Beginning with 3\.19\.0, subqueries and views on the right\-hand side of
> a LEFT JOIN operator could sometimes be
> [flattened](https://sqlite.org/optoverview.html#flattening) into the
> main query. The new optimization worked well for all of the test cases
> that the developers devised, and for millions of legacy test cases, but
> once 3\.19\.0 was released, users found some other cases where the optimization
> failed. Ticket
> [cad1ab4cb7b0fc344](https://sqlite.org/src/info/cad1ab4cb7b0fc344) contains
> examples.
> 
> These problems exist only in 3\.19\.0\. Users of SQLite 3\.19\.0 should
> upgrade, but users of all prior versions of SQLite are safe.
