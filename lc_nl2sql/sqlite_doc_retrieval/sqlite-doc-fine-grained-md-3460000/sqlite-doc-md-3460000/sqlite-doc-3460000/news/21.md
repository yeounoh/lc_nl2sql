### 2022\-07\-21 \- [Version 3\.39\.2](releaselog/3_39_2.html)


> Version 3\.39\.2 is a security release that addresses multiple long\-standing
> issues in SQLite. The most severe problem is identified by CVE\-2022\-35737\.
> That issue is associated with the auxiliary C\-language APIs
> of SQLite and cannot be reached using SQL or database inputs, and hence is
> unlikely to affect your application. Nevertheless, upgrading is recommended.
> The other issues are comparatively minor.
> This release also fixes a performance regression that appeared in version
> 3\.39\.0 that might affect some multi\-way joins that use LEFT JOIN.
