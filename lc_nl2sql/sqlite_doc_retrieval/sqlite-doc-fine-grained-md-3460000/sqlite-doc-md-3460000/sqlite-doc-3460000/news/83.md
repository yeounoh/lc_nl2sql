### 2016\-08\-11 \- Release 3\.14\.1


> SQLite [version 3\.14\.1](releaselog/3_14_1.html) adds a small patch to improve the performance
> of the pcache1TruncateUnsafe() routine for cases when the only a few
> pages on the end of the cache are being removed. This causes COMMITs
> to run faster when there is a very large page cache. Upgrading from
> version 3\.14 is optional.
