### 2019\-07\-10 \- Release 3\.29\.0


> Version 3\.29\.0 is a regularly scheduled maintenance release
> of SQLite containing miscellaneous performance and feature
> enhancements. See the [change log](releaselog/3_29_0.html) for
> details.
> 
> Beginning with this release, the
> [double\-quoted string literal](quirks.html#dblquote) misfeature is deprecated.
> The misfeature is still enabled by default, for legacy
> compatibility, however developers are encouraged to
> disable it at compile\-time using the
> [\-DSQLITE\_DQS\=0](compile.html#dqs) option, or at run\-time using
> the [SQLITE\_DBCONFIG\_DQS\_DML](c3ref/c_dbconfig_defensive.html#sqlitedbconfigdqsdml) and [SQLITE\_DBCONFIG\_DQS\_DDL](c3ref/c_dbconfig_defensive.html#sqlitedbconfigdqsddl)
> actions to the [sqlite3\_db\_config()](c3ref/db_config.html) interface. This is
> especially true for double\-quoted string literals in
> CREATE TABLE and CREATE INDEX statements, as those elements
> can cause unexpected problems following an ALTER TABLE.
> See ticket [9b78184be266fd70](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/9b78184be266fd70)
> for an example.
