### 2022\-09\-29 \- [Version 3\.39\.4](releaselog/3_39_4.html)


> Version 3\.39\.4 is a security release that addresses a single
> long\-standing problem in the [FTS3 extension](fts3.html). An attacker
> who is able to execute arbitrary SQL statements and who can create
> a corrupt database that is 2GB or larger in size might be able to trick
> FTS3 into overflowing an integer used to size a memory allocation,
> causing the allocation to be too small and ultimately resulting in
> a buffer overrun. The release also includes fixes for other
> obscure weaknesses, as described in the release notes.
