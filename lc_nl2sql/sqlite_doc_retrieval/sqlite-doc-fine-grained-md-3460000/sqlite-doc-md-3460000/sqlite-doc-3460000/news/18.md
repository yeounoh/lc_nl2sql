### 2022\-11\-16 \- [Version 3\.40\.0](releaselog/3_40_0.html)


> Version 3\.40\.0 is a new feature release of SQLite. See the
> [change log](releaselog/3_40_0.html) for details.
> Key enhancements in this release include:
> 1. Official support for compiling 
> [SQLite to WASM](https://sqlite.org/wasm/doc/trunk/index.md)
> and running it in a web browser.
> - New and improved [recovery extension](recovery.html) for extracting
> data from corrupted database files.
> 
> 
> 
> This release also includes performance enhancements and
> improvements to the query planner.
> 
> A psychological milestone: The performance benchmark that
> the SQLite developers have used for many years has for
> the first time dropped below 1 billion CPU cycles
> (measured using cachegrind) when run in [WAL mode](wal.html).
> This is less than half the number of CPU cycles used as
> recently as 8 years ago. (The graph below shows SQLite using
> a [rollback journal](lockingv3.html#rollback) which uses fewer CPU cycles at the expense
> of extra I/O. The benchmark passed through the 1 billion cycle
> barrier for rollback journals for the previous release.)
