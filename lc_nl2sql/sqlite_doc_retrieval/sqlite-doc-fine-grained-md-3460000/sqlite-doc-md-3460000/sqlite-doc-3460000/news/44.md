### 2020\-06\-04 \- Release 3\.32\.2


> The 3\.32\.2 release is a one\-line change relative to 3\.32\.1
> that fixes a long\-standing bug in the COMMIT command. Since
> [version 3\.17\.0](releaselog/3_17_0.html), if you were to retry a COMMIT command over
> and over after it returns [SQLITE\_BUSY](rescode.html#busy), it might eventually
> report success, even though it was still blocked. This patch
> fixes the problem.
