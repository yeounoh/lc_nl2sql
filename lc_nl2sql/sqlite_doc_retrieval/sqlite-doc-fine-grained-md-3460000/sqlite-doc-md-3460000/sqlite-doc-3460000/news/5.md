### 2024\-01\-30 \- [Version 3\.45\.1](releaselog/3_45_1.html)


> Version 3\.45\.1 is a patch against SQLite version 3\.45\.0\.
> 
> The main focus of this patch release is to restore certain
> undocumented legacy behavior in the [JSON SQL functions](json1.html) that
> the developers were unaware of but which some applications
> had come to depend on. This undocumented behavior was "fixed"
> in the 3\.45\.0, resulting in breakage for applications that were
> using it. So it has now been restored and documented.
> 
> Other obscure issues that have come up since the 3\.45\.0 release,
> some related to the release itself and some going back years,
> are also fixed.
