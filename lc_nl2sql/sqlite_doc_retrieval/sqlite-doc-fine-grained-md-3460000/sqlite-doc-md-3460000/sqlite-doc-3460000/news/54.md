### 2019\-02\-08 \- Release 3\.27\.1


> After release 3\.27\.0 was tagged, but before the build could
> be completed and uploaded, a 
> [long\-standing bug](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/4e8e4857d32d401f)
> in the query optimizer was reported via System.Data.SQLite.
> Since people will be upgrading anyhow, we decided 
> publish the fix for this newly discovered problems right
> away. Hence, 3\.27\.1 was released less than 24 hours after
> 3\.27\.0\.
> 
> It would have been better if the query optimizer bug had come to
> our attention one day earlier, so that we could have incorporated
> a fix into 3\.27\.0, but sometimes that's the way things go.
