### 2019\-04\-16 \- Release 3\.28\.0


> Version 3\.28\.0 is a regularly scheduled maintenance release
> of SQLite containing miscellaneous performance and feature
> enhancements. See the [change log](releaselog/3_28_0.html) for
> details.
> 
> This release fixes an obscure security issue. Applications
> using older versions of SQLite may be vulnerable if
> 1. SQLite is compiled with certain optional extensions
>  enabled, and
> - the attacker is able to inject arbitrary SQL.
> 
> 
> We are not aware of any applications that are vulnerable to
> this problem. On the other hand, we do not know about
> every application that uses SQLite. 
> If your application allows unauthenticated users on the internet
> (and hence potential attackers) to run arbitrary SQL and if
> you build SQLite with any of the optional extensions enabled,
> then you should take this upgrade at your earliest opportunity.
> 
> For further information about improving SQLite's robustness
> in internet\-facing applications, see the our
> [security recommendations](security.html).
