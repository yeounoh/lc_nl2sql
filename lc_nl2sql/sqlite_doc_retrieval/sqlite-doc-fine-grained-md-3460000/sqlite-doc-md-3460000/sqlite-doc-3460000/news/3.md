### 2024\-04\-15 \- [Version 3\.45\.3](releaselog/3_45_3.html)


> Version 3\.45\.3 is a patch release that fixes a few obscure problems,
> including:
> * The "old.\*" values in an [UPDATE trigger](lang_createtrigger.html) might be incorrect
>  if the trigger fires in response to an [UPSERT](lang_upsert.html).
> * The [sum()](lang_aggfunc.html#sumunc) function might return NULL in some cases where Infinity
>  would be a better answer.
> 
> 
> None of the problems are emergencies. Upgrade at your convenience.
