### 2017\-01\-03 \- Release 3\.16\.1


> SQLite [version 3\.16\.1](releaselog/3_16_1.html) fixes a bug in the row\-value logic for UPDATE
> statements inside of triggers. The bug has been there since row\-values
> were added by release 3\.15\.0, but was not discovered until just a few
> minutes after the 3\.16\.0 release was published, and so it was not fixed
> by 3\.16\.0\. This patch release is version 3\.16\.0 with the row\-value bug fix.
