### 2016\-04\-08 \- Release 3\.12\.1


> SQLite [version 3\.12\.1](releaselog/3_12_1.html) is an emergency patch release to address a 
>  [crash bug](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7f7f8026eda38) that snuck
>  into [version 3\.12\.0](releaselog/3_12_0.html). Upgrading from version 3\.12\.0 is highly
>  recommended.
> Another minor problem involving datatypes on [view](lang_createview.html) columns, and
>  a query planner deficiency are fixed at the same time. These two
>  issues did not justify a new release on their own, but since a release
>  is being issued to deal with the crash bug, we included these other
>  fixes for good measure.
