### 2023\-11\-01 \- [Version 3\.44\.0](releaselog/3_44_0.html)


> Version 3\.44\.0 is new enhancement release of SQLite.
> 
> It has only been 69 days since the previous major
> release (3\.43\.0\). The original plan was for version 3\.44\.0
> to occur at a spacing of approximately 120 days from the
> prior release. However, the code accumulated so many important
> enhancements that is seemed better to accelerate the release
> of 3\.44\.0, thus getting those enhancements into circulation.
> This means that some enhancements that where originally
> planned to be in 3\.44\.0 have been deferred until subsequent
> releases.
