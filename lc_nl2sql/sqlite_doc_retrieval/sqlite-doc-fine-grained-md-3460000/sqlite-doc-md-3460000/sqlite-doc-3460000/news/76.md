### 2017\-01\-06 \- Release 3\.16\.2


> One of the performance optimizations added in 3\.16\.0 caused triggers
> and foreign keys to malfunction for the [REPLACE](lang_replace.html) statement on
> [WITHOUT ROWID](withoutrowid.html) tables that lack secondary indexes. This patch
> release fixes the problem. See ticket 
> [30027b613b4](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/30027b613b4) for details.
