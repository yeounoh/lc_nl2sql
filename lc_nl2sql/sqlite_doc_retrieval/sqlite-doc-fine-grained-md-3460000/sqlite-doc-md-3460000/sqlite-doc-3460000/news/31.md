### 2021\-12\-30 \- [Version 3\.37\.1](releaselog/3_37_1.html)


> Version 3\.37\.1 fixes a bug in the [UPSERT](lang_upsert.html) logic, introduced by
> the UPSERT enhancements of [version 3\.35\.0](releaselog/3_35_0.html), that can cause
> incorrect byte\-code to be generated in some cases, resulting
> in an infinite loop in the byte code, or a NULL\-pointer dereference.
> This patch release also fixes some other minor problems with
> assert() statements and in the [CLI](cli.html).
