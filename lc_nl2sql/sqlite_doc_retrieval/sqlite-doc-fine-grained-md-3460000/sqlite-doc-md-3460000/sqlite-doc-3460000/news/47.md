### 2020\-01\-27 \- Release 3\.31\.1


> Applications that use SQLite should only interface with SQLite
> through the officially published APIs. Applications should not
> depend upon or use the internal data structures of SQLite as those
> structures might change from one release to another. However, there
> is a popular application that does depend on the details of the
> internal layout of data in an internal SQLite data structure, and
> those details changed in version 3\.31\.0, breaking the application.
> This is, technically, a bug in the application, not in SQLite.
> But it is within the power of SQLite to fix it, by reverting the
> internal data structure change, and so that is what we have done
> for the 3\.31\.1 release.
