### 2016\-10\-14 \- Release 3\.15\.0


> SQLite [version 3\.15\.0](releaselog/3_15_0.html) is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
> The key feature in this release is the added support for
> [row values](rowvalue.html). There are also other enhancements and
> fixes for a number of obscure bugs.
> 
> The 3\.15\.0 release uses about 7% fewer CPU cycles than 3\.14\.2\.
> Most of the improvement in this release
> is in the SQL parser, query planner, and
> byte\-code generator (the front\-end) corresponding
> to the [sqlite3\_prepare\_v2()](c3ref/prepare.html) interface. Overall,
> version 3\.15\.0 uses about half as much CPU time as
> version 3\.8\.1 (2013\-10\-17\). These
> performance measurements are made using the "speedtest1\.c"
> workload on x64 compiled with gcc and \-Os. Performance
> improvements may vary with different platforms and
> workloads.
