### 2018\-09\-25 \- Release 3\.25\.2


> SQLite [version 3\.25\.2](releaselog/3_25_2.html) is another patch against 3\.25\.0 that fixes still
> more problems associated with the new [window function](windowfunctions.html) feature and the
> [ALTER TABLE](lang_altertable.html) enhancements. Of particular note is the new
> [PRAGMA legacy\_alter\_table\=ON](pragma.html#pragma_legacy_alter_table) command, which causes the ALTER TABLE RENAME
> command to behave in the same goofy way that it did before the enhancements
> found in version 3\.25\.0 â†’ references to renamed tables that are inside
> the bodies of triggers and views are not updated. The legacy behavior is
> arguably a bug, but some programs depend on the older buggy behavior. The
> 3\.25\.2 release also contains a fix to [window function](windowfunctions.html) processing for
> VIEWs. There also a slew of other minor fixes that affect obscure
> compile\-time options. See the
> [Fossil Timeline](https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?r=branch-3.25) for
> details.
