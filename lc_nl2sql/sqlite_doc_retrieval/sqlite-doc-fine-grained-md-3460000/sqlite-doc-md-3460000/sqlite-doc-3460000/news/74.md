### 2017\-03\-30 \- Release 3\.18\.0


> SQLite [version 3\.18\.0](releaselog/3_18_0.html) is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
> 
> This release features an initial implementation the 
> "[PRAGMA optimize](pragma.html#pragma_optimize)" command. This command can now be used to cause
> [ANALYZE](lang_analyze.html) to be run on an as\-needed basis. Applications should invoke
> "PRAGMA optimize" just before closing the [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html).
> The "PRAGMA optimize" statement will likely be enhanced to do other
> kinds of automated database maintenance in future releases.
> 
> The [Fossil](https://www.fossil-scm.org/) version control system that is
> used to manage the SQLite project has been upgraded to use SHA3\-256 hashes
> instead of SHA1\. Therefore, the version identifications for SQLite now
> show a 64\-hex\-digit SHA3\-256 hash rather than the 40\-hex\-digit SHA1 hash.
> 
> See the [change log](releaselog/3_18_0.html) for other enhancements and optimizations
> in this release.
