### 2016\-04\-18 \- Release 3\.12\.2


> Yikes! The 3\.12\.0 and 3\.12\.1 releases contain a backwards compatibility bug!
>  Tables that declare a column with type "INTEGER" PRIMARY KEY
>  (where the datatype name INTEGER is quoted) generate an incompatible
>  database file. The mistake came about because the developers have never
>  thought to put a typename in quotes before, and so there was no documentation 
>  of that capability nor any tests. (There are tests now, though, of course.)
>  Instances of quoting the datatype name are probably infrequent in the wild,
>  so we do not expect the impact of this bug to be too severe.
>  Upgrading is still strongly recommended.
> Fixes for three other minor issues were included in this patch release.
>  The other issues would have normally been deferred until the next scheduled
>  release, but since a patch release is being issued anyhow, they might as
>  well be included.
