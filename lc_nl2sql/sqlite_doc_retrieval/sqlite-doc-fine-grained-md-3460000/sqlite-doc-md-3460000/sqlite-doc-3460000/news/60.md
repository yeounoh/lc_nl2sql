### 2018\-09\-15 \- Release 3\.25\.0


> SQLite [version 3\.25\.0](releaselog/3_25_0.html) is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
> Two big enhancements in this release:
> 1. Support for [window functions](windowfunctions.html) was added, using the PostgreSQL documentation
> as the baseline.
> - The [ALTER TABLE](lang_altertable.html) command was enhanced to support renaming of columns, and
> so that column and table renames are propagated into trigger bodies and views.
> 
> 
> In addition, there are various performance enhancements and minor fixes.
> One bug of note is 
> [ticket 9936b2fa443fec](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/9936b2fa443fec03ff25)
> which describes a hard\-to\-reach condition where the ORDER BY LIMIT
> optimization might cause an infinite loop during query evaluation. 
> This ticket raised a lot of
> concern on 
> [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17964243) and
> [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9ezy8c/serious_bug_causing_infinite_loop_in_some_queries/),
> probably due to my choice of the ticket
> title. "Infinite Loop" sounds scary. But I argue that the bug isn't really
> all that bad in that it is very difficult to reach, will show up during
> testing (rather than magically appearing after a product is
> deployed), does not cause any data loss, and does not return an
> incorrect result. It was an important error, but not nearly as dire
> as many people interpreted it to be. And, in any event, it is fixed now.
