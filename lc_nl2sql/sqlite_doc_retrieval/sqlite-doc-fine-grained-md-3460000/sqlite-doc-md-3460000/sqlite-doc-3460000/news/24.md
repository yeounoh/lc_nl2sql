### 2022\-05\-06 \- [Version 3\.38\.5](releaselog/3_38_5.html)


> The 3\.38\.4 patch release included a minor change to the [CLI](cli.html) source code
> that did not work. The release manager only ran a subset of the normal
> release tests, and hence did not catch the problem. As a result, the CLI
> will segfault when using columnar output modes in version 3\.38\.4\. This
> blunder did not affect the core SQLite library. It only affected the CLI.
> 
> Take\-away lesson: **Always** run **all** of your tests prior to
> a release \- even a trival patch release. **Always**.
> 
> The 3\.38\.5 patch release fixes the 3\.38\.4 blunder.
