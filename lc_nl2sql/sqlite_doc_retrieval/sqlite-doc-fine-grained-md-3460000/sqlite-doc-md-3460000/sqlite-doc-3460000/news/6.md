### 2024\-01\-15 \- [Version 3\.45\.0](releaselog/3_45_0.html)


> Version 3\.45\.0 is an enhancement release of SQLite.
> 
> The most impactful change is likely enhancements to
> the [JSON SQL functions](json1.html) such that they are now able to
> store their internal JSON parse trees in the database
> as BLOB values. This can significantly increase the
> performance of applications that process large JSON
> strings as it omits the need to translate JSON text
> to and from the internal binary format used by SQLite.
> 
> A second noteworthy change is that any
> [application\-defined SQL functions](appfunc.html) that make use of
> the [sqlite3\_result\_subtype()](c3ref/result_subtype.html) interface must now include
> the [SQLITE\_RESULT\_SUBTYPE](c3ref/c_deterministic.html#sqliteresultsubtype) attribute when the function
> is registered using [sqlite3\_create\_function()](c3ref/create_function.html) or similar.
> Failure to include the SQLITE\_RESULT\_SUBTYPE attribute on
> functions that use [sqlite3\_result\_subtype()](c3ref/result_subtype.html) might result
> in incorrect answers.
> 
> See the [change log](releaselog/3_45_0.html)
> for additional enhancements that are part of the 3\.45\.0 release.
