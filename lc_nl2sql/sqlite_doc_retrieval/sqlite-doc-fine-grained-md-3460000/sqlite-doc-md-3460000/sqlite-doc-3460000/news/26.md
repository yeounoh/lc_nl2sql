### 2022\-04\-27 \- [Version 3\.38\.3](releaselog/3_38_3.html)


> Version 3\.38\.3 fixes a bug in the automatic\-index and Bloom filter
> construction logic that might cause SQLite to be overly aggressive
> in the use of ON clause constraints, resulting in an incorrect
> automatic\-index or Bloom filter that excludes some valid rows from
> output. The bug was introduced in version 3\.38\.0\. Other minor
> changes were tossed in to complete the patch.
