### 2017\-02\-13 \- Release 3\.17\.0


> SQLite [version 3\.17\.0](releaselog/3_17_0.html) is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
> 
> Most of the changes in this release are performance optimizations.
> Optimizations to the [R\-Tree extension](rtree.html) are especially noticeable.
> 
> In this release, the default size of the 
> [lookaside buffer](malloc.html#lookaside) allocated for each database connection
> is increased from 64,000 to 120,000 bytes. This provides improved
> performance on many common workloads in exchange for a small increase
> in memory usage.
> Applications that value a small memory footprint over raw speed
> can change the lookaside buffer size back to its old value (or to zero)
> using the [SQLITE\_DEFAULT\_LOOKASIDE](compile.html#default_lookaside) compile\-time option, or the
> [sqlite3\_config(SQLITE\_CONFIG\_LOOKASIDE)](c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfiglookaside)
> start\-time setting, or the
> [sqlite3\_db\_config(SQLITE\_DBCONFIG\_LOOKASIDE)](c3ref/c_dbconfig_defensive.html#sqlitedbconfiglookaside)
> run\-time setting.
