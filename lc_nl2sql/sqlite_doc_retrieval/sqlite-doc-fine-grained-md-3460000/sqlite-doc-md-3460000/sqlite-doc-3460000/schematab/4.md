# 4\. Creation and Modification Of The Schema Table


SQLite creates the schema table upon database creation and modifies
its content as SQLite users submit DDL statements for execution. There
is no need for users to modify it under normal circumstances, and they
bear the risk of [database corruption](howtocorrupt.html#cfgerr) if they do modify it.
