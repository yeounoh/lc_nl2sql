# 1\. Introduction


Every SQLite database contains a single "schema table" that stores the
schema for that database. The schema for a database is a description of
all of the other tables, indexes, triggers, and views that are
contained within the database. The schema table looks like this:




> ```
> 
> CREATE TABLE sqlite_schema(
>   type text,
>   name text,
>   tbl_name text,
>   rootpage integer,
>   sql text
> );
> 
> ```


The sqlite\_schema table contains one row for each table, index, view,
and trigger (collectively "objects") in the schema, except there
is no entry for the sqlite\_schema table itself. See the
[schema storage](fileformat2.html#ffschema) subsection of the [file format](fileformat2.html) documentation for
additional information on how SQLite uses the sqlite\_schema table
internally.
