# 2\. Alternative Names


The schema table can always be referenced using the name "sqlite\_schema",
especially if qualifed by the schema name like 
"main.sqlite\_schema" or "temp.sqlite\_schema". But for historical
compatibility, some alternative names are also recognized, including:



1. sqlite\_master
2. sqlite\_temp\_schema
3. sqlite\_temp\_master



Alternatives (2\) and (3\) only work for the TEMP database associated
with each database connection, but alternative (1\) works anywhere.
For historical reasons, callbacks from the [sqlite3\_set\_authorizer()](c3ref/set_authorizer.html)
interface always refer to the schema table using names (1\) or (3\).
