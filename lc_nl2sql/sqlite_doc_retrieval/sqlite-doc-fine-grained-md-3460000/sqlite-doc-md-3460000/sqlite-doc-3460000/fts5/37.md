## 6\.2\. The 'crisismerge' Configuration Option


The 'crisismerge' option is similar to 'automerge', in that it determines
how and how often the component b\-trees that make up the full\-text index are
merged together. Once there exist *C* or more b\-trees on a single level
within the full\-text index, where *C* is the value of the 'crisismerge'
option, all b\-trees on the level are immediately merged into a single b\-tree.



The difference between this option and the 'automerge' option is that when
the 'automerge' limit is reached FTS5 only begins to merge the b\-trees
together. Most of the work is performed as part of subsequent INSERT,
UPDATE or DELETE operations. Whereas when the 'crisismerge' limit is reached,
the offending b\-trees are all merged immediately. This means that an INSERT,
UPDATE or DELETE that triggers a crisis\-merge may take a long time to
complete.



The default 'crisismerge' value is 16\. There is no maximum limit. Attempting
to set the 'crisismerge' parameter to a value of 0 or 1 is equivalent to
setting it to the default value (16\). It is an error to attempt to set the
'crisismerge' option to a negative value.




```
INSERT INTO ft(ft, rank) VALUES('crisismerge', 16);

```
