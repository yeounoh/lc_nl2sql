## 6\.13\. The 'usermerge' Configuration Option


 This command is used to set the persistent "usermerge" option.



 The usermerge option is similar to the automerge and crisismerge options.
It is the minimum number of b\-tree segments that will be merged together by
a 'merge' command with a positive parameter. For example:




```
INSERT INTO ft(ft, rank) VALUES('usermerge', 4);

```

 The default value of the usermerge option is 4\. The minimum allowed value
is 2, and the maximum 16\.
