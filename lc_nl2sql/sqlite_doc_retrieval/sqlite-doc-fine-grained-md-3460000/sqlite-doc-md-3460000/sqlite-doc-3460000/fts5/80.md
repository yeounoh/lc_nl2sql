### Other Issues


1. The functionality provided by the fts4aux module is now provided
 by [fts5vocab](fts5.html#the_fts5vocab_virtual_table_module). The schema of these two tables is slightly different.
2. The FTS3/4 "merge\=X,Y" command has been replaced by the
 [FTS5 merge command](fts5.html#the_merge_command).
3. The FTS3/4 "automerge\=X" command has been replaced by the
 [FTS5 automerge option](fts5.html#the_automerge_configuration_option).
