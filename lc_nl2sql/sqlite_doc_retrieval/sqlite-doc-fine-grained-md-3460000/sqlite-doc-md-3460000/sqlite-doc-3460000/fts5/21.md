## 4\.4\. External Content and Contentless Tables



Normally, when a row is inserted into an FTS5 table, in addition to building
the index, FTS5 makes a copy of the original row content.
When column values are requested from the FTS5 table by the user or by an
auxiliary function implementation, those values are
read from that private copy of the content. The "content" option may be used
to create an FTS5 table that stores only FTS full\-text index entries.
Because the column values themselves are usually much larger than the
associated full\-text index entries, this can save significant database space.




There are two ways to use the "content" option:


* By setting it to an empty string to create a contentless FTS5 table. In
 this case FTS5 assumes that the original column values are unavailable
 to it when processing queries. Full\-text queries and some auxiliary
 functions can still be used, but no column values apart from the rowid
 may be read from the table.
* By setting it to the name of a database object (table, virtual table or
 view) that may be queried by FTS5 at any time to retrieve the column
 values. This is known as an "external content" table. In this case all
 FTS5 functionality may be used, but it is the responsibility of the user
 to ensure that the contents of the full\-text index are consistent with
 the named database object. If they are not, query results may be
 unpredictable.
