## 4\.2\. Prefix Indexes


 By default, FTS5 maintains a single index recording the location of each
token instance within the document set. This means that querying for complete
tokens is fast, as it requires a single lookup, but querying for a prefix
token can be slow, as it requires a range scan. For example, to query for
the prefix token "abc\*" requires a range scan of all tokens greater than
or equal to "abc" and less than "abd".



 A prefix index is a separate index that records the location of all
instances of prefix tokens of a certain length in characters used to speed
up queries for prefix tokens. For example, optimizing a query for prefix
token "abc\*" requires a prefix index of three\-character prefixes.



 To add prefix indexes to an FTS5 table, the "prefix" option is set to
either a single positive integer or a text value containing a white\-space
separated list of one or more positive integer values. A prefix index is
created for each integer specified. If more than one "prefix" option is
specified as part of a single CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement, all apply.




```
-- Two ways to create an FTS5 table that maintains prefix indexes for
-- two and three character prefix tokens.
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft USING fts5(a, b, prefix='2 3');
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft USING fts5(a, b, prefix=2, prefix=3);

```
