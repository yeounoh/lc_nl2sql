## 2\.2\. Building a Loadable Extension


Alternatively, FTS5 may be built as a loadable extension.



The canonical FTS5 source code consists of a series of \*.c and other files
in the "ext/fts5" directory of the SQLite source tree. A build process reduces
this to just two files \- "fts5\.c" and "fts5\.h" \- which may be used to build an
SQLite loadable extension.



1. Obtain the latest SQLite code from fossil.
2. Create a Makefile as described in [How To Compile SQLite](howtocompile.html).
3. Build the "fts5\.c" target. Which also creates fts5\.h.



```
$ wget -c https://www.sqlite.org/src/tarball/SQLite-trunk.tgz?uuid=trunk -O SQLite-trunk.tgz
.... output ...
$ tar -xzf SQLite-trunk.tgz
$ cd SQLite-trunk
$ ./configure && make fts5.c
... lots of output ...
$ ls fts5.[ch]
fts5.c        fts5.h

```


 The code in "fts5\.c" may then be compiled into a loadable extension or
 statically linked into an application as described in
 [Compiling Loadable Extensions](loadext.html#build). There are two entry points defined, both
 of which do the same thing:



* sqlite3\_fts\_init
* sqlite3\_fts5\_init



 The other file, "fts5\.h", is not required to compile the FTS5 extension.
 It is used by applications that implement [custom FTS5 tokenizers or auxiliary functions](fts5.html#extending_fts5).
