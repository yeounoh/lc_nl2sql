# 5\.  Auxiliary Functions


 Auxiliary functions are similar to [SQL scalar functions](lang_corefunc.html),
except that they may only be used within full\-text queries (those that use
the MATCH operator, or LIKE/GLOB with the trigram tokenizer) on an FTS5 table.
Their results are calculated based not only on the arguments passed to them,
but also on the current match and matched row. For example, an auxiliary
function may return a numeric value indicating the accuracy of the match (see
the [bm25()](fts5.html#the_bm25_function) function), or a fragment of text from the matched row
that contains one or more instances of the search terms (see the [snippet()](fts5.html#the_snippet_function) function).



To invoke an auxiliary function, the name of the FTS5 table should be
specified as the first argument. Other arguments may follow the first,
depending on the specific auxiliary function being invoked. For example, to
invoke the "highlight" function:




```
SELECT highlight(email, 2, '<b>', '</b>') FROM email WHERE email MATCH 'fts5'

```

The built\-in auxiliary functions provided as part of FTS5 are described in
the following section. Applications may also implement
[custom auxiliary functions in C](fts5.html#custom_auxiliary_functions).
