## 2\.1\. Building FTS5 as part of SQLite


As of [version 3\.9\.0](releaselog/3_9_0.html) (2015\-10\-14\),
FTS5 is included as part of the SQLite [amalgamation](amalgamation.html).
If using one of the two autoconf build system, FTS5 is
enabled by specifying the "\-\-enable\-fts5" option when running the configure
script. (FTS5 is currently disabled by default for the
source\-tree configure script and enabled by default for
the amalgamation configure script, but these defaults might
change in the future.)



Or, if sqlite3\.c is compiled using some other build system, by arranging for
the SQLITE\_ENABLE\_FTS5 pre\-processor symbol to be defined.
