## 5\.1\. Built\-in Auxiliary Functions


 FTS5 provides three built\-in auxiliary functions:



* The [bm25() auxiliary function](fts5.html#the_bm25_function) returns a real value
 reflecting the accuracy of the current match. Better matches are
 assigned numerically lower values.
* The [highlight() auxiliary function](fts5.html#the_highlight_function) returns a copy
 of the text from one of the columns of the current match with each
 instance of a queried term within the result surrounded by specified
 markup (for example "\<b\>" and "\</b\>").
* The [snippet() auxiliary function](fts5.html#the_snippet_function) selects a short
 fragment of text from one of the columns of the matched row and returns
 it with each instance of a queried term surrounded by markup in
 the same manner as the highlight() function. The fragment of text is
 selected so as to maximize the number of distinct queried terms it
 contains. Higher weight is given to snippets that occur at the start
 of a column value, or that immediately follow "." or ":" characters
 in the text.
