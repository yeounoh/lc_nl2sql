### 4\.3\.1\. Unicode61 Tokenizer


 The unicode tokenizer classifies all unicode characters as either
"separator" or "token" characters. By default all space and punctuation
characters, as defined by Unicode 6\.1, are considered separators, and all
other characters as token characters. More specifically, all unicode
characters assigned to a
[general category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property#General_Category) beginning with "L" or "N" (letters and numbers,
specifically) or to category "Co" ("other, private use") are considered tokens.
All other characters are separators.



Each contiguous run of one or more token characters is considered to be a
token. The tokenizer is case\-insensitive according to the rules defined by
Unicode 6\.1\.



 By default, diacritics are removed from all Latin script characters. This
means, for example, that "A", "a", "À", "à", "Â" and "â"
are all considered to be equivalent.



 Any arguments following "unicode61" in the token specification are treated
as a list of alternating option names and values. Unicode61 supports the
following options:





| Option | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| remove\_diacritics | This option should be set to "0", "1" or "2". The default value is "1".  If it is set to "1" or "2", then diacritics are removed from Latin script  characters as described above. However, if it is set to "1", then diacritics  are not removed in the fairly uncommon case where a single unicode codepoint  is used to represent a character with more that one diacritic. For example,  diacritics are not removed from codepoint 0x1ED9 ("LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH  CIRCUMFLEX AND DOT BELOW"). This is technically a bug, but cannot be fixed  without creating backwards compatibility problems. If this option is set to  "2", then diacritics are correctly removed from all Latin characters. |
| categories | This option may be used to modify the set of Unicode general categories  that are considered to correspond to token characters. The argument must  consist of a space separated list of two\-character general category  abbreviations (e.g. "Lu" or "Nd"), or of the same with the second character  replaced with an asterisk ("\*"), interpreted as a glob pattern. The default  value is "L\* N\* Co". |
| tokenchars | This option is used to specify additional unicode characters that  should be considered token characters, even if they are white\-space or  punctuation characters according to Unicode 6\.1\. All characters in the  string that this option is set to are considered token characters. |
| separators | This option is used to specify additional unicode characters that  should be considered as separator characters, even if they are token  characters according to Unicode 6\.1\. All characters in the string that  this option is set to are considered separators. |


 For example:




```
-- Create an FTS5 table that does not remove diacritics from Latin
-- script characters, and that considers hyphens and underscore characters
-- to be part of tokens. 
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft USING fts5(a, b,
    tokenize = "unicode61 remove_diacritics 0 tokenchars '-_'"
);

```

 or:




```
-- Create an FTS5 table that, as well as the default token character classes,
-- considers characters in class "Mn" to be token characters.
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft USING fts5(a, b,
    tokenize = "unicode61 categories 'L* N* Co Mn'"
);

```

 The fts5 unicode61 tokenizer is byte\-for\-byte compatible with the fts3/4
unicode61 tokenizer.
