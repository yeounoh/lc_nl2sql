### 4\.3\.2\. Ascii Tokenizer


 The Ascii tokenizer is similar to the Unicode61 tokenizer, except that:



* All non\-ASCII characters (those with codepoints greater than 127\) are
 always considered token characters. If any non\-ASCII characters are specified
 as part of the separators option, they are ignored.
* Case\-folding is only performed for ASCII characters. So while "A" and
 "a" are considered to be equivalent, "Ã" and "ã" are distinct.
* The remove\_diacritics option is not supported.


 For example:




```
-- Create an FTS5 table that uses the ascii tokenizer, but does not
-- consider numeric characters to be part of tokens.
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft USING fts5(a, b,
    tokenize = "ascii separators '0123456789'"
);

```
