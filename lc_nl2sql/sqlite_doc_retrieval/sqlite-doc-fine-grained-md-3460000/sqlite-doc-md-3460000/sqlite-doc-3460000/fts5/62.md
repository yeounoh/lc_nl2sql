## 9\.1\. Varint Format


The sections below refer to 64\-bit signed integers stored in "varint" form.
FTS5 uses the same varint format as used in various places by the SQLite core.



A varint is between 1 and 9 bytes in length. The varint consists of either
zero or more bytes which have the high\-order bit set followed by a single byte
with the high\-order bit clear, or nine bytes, whichever is shorter. The lower
seven bits of each of the first eight bytes and all 8 bits of the ninth byte
are used to reconstruct the 64\-bit twos\-complement integer. Varints are
big\-endian: bits taken from the earlier byte of the varint are more significant
than bits taken from the later bytes.
