## 3\.4\. FTS5 Initial Token Queries



If a "^" character appears immediately before a phrase that is not part of a
NEAR query, then that phrase only matches a document only if it starts at the
first token in a column. The "^" syntax may be combined with a
[column filter](fts5.html#fts5_column_filters), but may not be inserted into the middle of
a phrase.




```
... MATCH '^one'              -- first token in any column must be "one"
... MATCH '^ one + two'       -- phrase "one two" must appear at start of a column
... MATCH '^ "one two"'       -- same as previous 
... MATCH 'a : ^two'          -- first token of column "a" must be "two"
... MATCH 'NEAR(^one, two)'   -- syntax error! 
... MATCH 'one + ^two'        -- syntax error! 
... MATCH '"^one two"'        -- May not work as expected!

```
