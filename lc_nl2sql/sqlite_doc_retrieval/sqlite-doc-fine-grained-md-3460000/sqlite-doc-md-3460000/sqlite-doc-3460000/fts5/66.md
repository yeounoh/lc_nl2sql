### 9\.2\.3\. Averages Record Format


The averages record, which is always stored with id\=1 in the %\_data table,
does not store the average of anything. Instead, it contains a vector of
(nCol\+1\) packed varint values, where nCol is the number of columns in the FTS5
table, including unindexed columns. The first varint contains the total
number of rows in the FTS5 table. The second contains the total number of
tokens in all values stored in the leftmost FTS5 table column. The third the
number of tokens in all values for the next leftmost, and so on. The value for
unindexed columns is always zero.
