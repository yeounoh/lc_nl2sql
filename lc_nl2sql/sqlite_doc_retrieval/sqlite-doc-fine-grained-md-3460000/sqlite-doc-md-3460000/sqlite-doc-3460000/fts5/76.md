## Application Porting Guide


 In order to use FTS5 instead of FTS3 or FTS4, applications usually require
minimal modifications. Most of these fall into three categories \- changes
required to the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement used to create the FTS table,
changes required to SELECT queries used to execute queries against the table,
and changes required to applications that use [FTS auxiliary functions](fts3.html#snippet).
