### 5\.1\.3\. The snippet() function


The snippet() function is similar to highlight(), except that instead of
returning entire column values, it automatically selects and extracts a
short fragment of document text to process and return. The snippet() function
must be passed five parameters following the table name argument:



1. An integer indicating the index of the FTS table column to select
 the returned text from. Columns are numbered from left to right
 starting at zero. A negative value indicates that the column should
 be automatically selected.
2. The text to insert before each phrase match within the returned text.
3. The text to insert after each phrase match within the returned text.
4. The text to add to the start or end of the selected text to indicate
 that the returned text does not occur at the start or end of its column,
 respectively.
5. The maximum number of tokens in the returned text. This must be greater
 than zero and equal to or less than 64\.
