## 6\.9\. The 'pgsz' Configuration Option


 This command is used to set the persistent "pgsz" option.



 The full\-text index maintained by FTS5 is stored as a series of fixed\-size
blobs in a database table. It is not strictly necessary for all blobs that make
up a full\-text index to be the same size. The pgsz option determines the size
of all blobs created by subsequent index writers. The default value is 1000\.




```
INSERT INTO ft(ft, rank) VALUES('pgsz', 4072);

```
