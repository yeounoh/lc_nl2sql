## 3\.3\. FTS5 Prefix Queries



If a "\*" character follows a string within an FTS expression, then the final
token extracted from the string is marked as a **prefix token**. As you
might expect, a prefix token matches any document token of which it is a
prefix. For example, the first two queries in the following block will match
any document that contains the token "one" immediately followed by the token
"two" and then any token that begins with "thr".




```
... MATCH '"one two thr" * '
... MATCH 'one + two + thr*'
... MATCH '"one two thr*"'      -- May not work as expected!

```

The final query in the block above may not work as expected. Because the
"\*" character is inside the double\-quotes, it will be passed to the tokenizer,
which will likely discard it (or perhaps, depending on the specific tokenizer
in use, include it as part of the final token) instead of recognizing it as
a special FTS character.
