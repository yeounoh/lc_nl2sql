## 3\.1\. FTS5 Strings



Within an FTS expression a **string** may be specified in one of two ways:



* By enclosing it in double quotes ("). Within a string, any embedded
 double quote characters may be escaped SQL\-style \- by adding a second
 double\-quote character.
* As an FTS5 bareword that is not "AND", "OR" or "NOT" (case sensitive).
 An FTS5 bareword is a string of one or more consecutive characters that
 are all either:

 


	+ Non\-ASCII range characters (i.e. unicode codepoints greater
	 than 127\), or
	+ One of the 52 upper and lower case ASCII characters, or
	+ One of the 10 decimal digit ASCII characters, or
	+ The underscore character (unicode codepoint 96\).
	+ The substitute character (unicode codepoint 26\).

 Strings that include any other characters must be quoted. Characters
 that are not currently allowed in barewords, are not quote characters and
 do not currently serve any special purpose in FTS5 query expressions may
 at some point in the future be allowed in barewords or used to implement
 new query functionality. This means that queries that are currently
 syntax errors because they include such a character outside of a quoted
 string may be interpreted differently by some future version of FTS5\.
