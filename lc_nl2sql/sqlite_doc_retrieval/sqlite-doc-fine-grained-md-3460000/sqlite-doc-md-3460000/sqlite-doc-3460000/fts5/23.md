### 4\.4\.2\. Contentless\-Delete Tables


As of version 3\.43\.0, also available are contentless\-delete tables.
A contentless\-delete table is created by setting the content option to an
empty string and also setting the contentless\_delete option to 1\. For example:




```
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE f1 USING fts5(a, b, c, content='', contentless_delete=1);

```

A contentless\-delete table differs from a contentless table in that:



* Contentless\-delete tables support both DELETE and "INSERT OR REPLACE
 INTO" statements.
* Contentless\-delete tables support UPDATE statements, but only if new
 values are supplied for all user\-defined columns of the fts5 table.
* Contentless\-delete tables do **not** support the 
 [FTS5 delete command](fts5.html#the_delete_command).



```
-- Supported UPDATE statement:
UPDATE f1 SET a=?, b=?, c=? WHERE rowid=?;

-- This UPDATE is not supported, as it does not supply a new value
-- for column "c".
UPDATE f1 SET a=?, b=? WHERE rowid=?;

```

 Unless backwards compatibility is required, new code should prefer
contentless\-delete tables to contentless tables.
