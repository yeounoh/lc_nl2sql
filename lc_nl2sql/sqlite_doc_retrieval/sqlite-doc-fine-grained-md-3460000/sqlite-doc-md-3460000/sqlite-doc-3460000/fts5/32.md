### 5\.1\.2\. The highlight() function


 The highlight() function returns a copy of the text from a specified
column of the current row with extra markup text inserted to mark the start
and end of phrase matches.



The highlight() must be invoked with exactly three arguments following
the table name. To be interpreted as follows:



1. An integer indicating the index of the FTS table column to read the
 text from. Columns are numbered from left to right starting at zero.
2. The text to insert before each phrase match.
3. The text to insert after each phrase match.


For example:




```
-- Return a copy of the text from the leftmost column of the current
-- row, with phrase matches marked using html "b" tags.
SELECT highlight(fts, 0, '<b>', '</b>') FROM fts WHERE fts MATCH ?

```

In cases where two or more phrase instances overlap (share one or more
tokens in common), a single open and close marker is inserted for each set
of overlapping phrases. For example:




```
-- Assuming this:
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft USING fts5(a);
INSERT INTO ft VALUES('a b c x c d e');
INSERT INTO ft VALUES('a b c c d e');
INSERT INTO ft VALUES('a b c d e');

-- The following SELECT statement returns these three rows:
--   '[a b c] x [c d e]'
--   '[a b c] [c d e]'
--   '[a b c d e]'
SELECT highlight(ft, 0, '[', ']') FROM ft WHERE ft MATCH 'a+b+c AND c+d+e';

```
