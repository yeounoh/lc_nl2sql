### 4\.3\.3\. Porter Tokenizer


 The porter tokenizer is a wrapper tokenizer. It takes the output of some
other tokenizer and applies the
[porter stemming algorithm](https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/)
to each token before it returns it to FTS5\. This allows search terms like
"correction" to match similar words such as "corrected" or "correcting". The
porter stemmer algorithm is designed for use with English language terms
only \- using it with other languages may or may not improve search utility.



 By default, the porter tokenizer operates as a wrapper around the default
tokenizer (unicode61\). Or, if one or more extra arguments are added to the
"tokenize" option following "porter", they are treated as a specification for
the underlying tokenizer that the porter stemmer uses. For example:




```
-- Two ways to create an FTS5 table that uses the porter tokenizer to
-- stem the output of the default tokenizer (unicode61). 
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t1 USING fts5(x, tokenize = porter);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t1 USING fts5(x, tokenize = 'porter unicode61');

-- A porter tokenizer used to stem the output of the unicode61 tokenizer,
-- with diacritics removed before stemming.
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t1 USING fts5(x, tokenize = 'porter unicode61 remove_diacritics 1');

```
