## 3\.2\. FTS5 Phrases



Each string in an fts5 query is parsed ("tokenized") by the 
[tokenizer](fts5.html#tokenizers) and a list of zero or more **tokens**, or
terms, extracted. For example, the default tokenizer tokenizes the string "alpha
beta gamma" to three separate tokens \- "alpha", "beta" and "gamma" \- in that
order.




FTS queries are made up of **phrases**. A phrase is an ordered list of
one or more tokens. The tokens from each string in the query each make up a
single phrase. Two phrases can be concatenated into a single large phrase
using the "\+" operator. For example, assuming the tokenizer module being used
tokenizes the input "one.two.three" to three separate tokens, the following
four queries all specify the same phrase:




```
... MATCH '"one two three"'
... MATCH 'one + two + three'
... MATCH '"one two" + three'
... MATCH 'one.two.three'

```


A phrase matches a document if the document contains at least one sub\-sequence
of tokens that matches the sequence of tokens that make up the phrase.
