### Auxiliary Function Changes


 FTS5 has no matchinfo() or offsets() function, and the snippet() function
is not as fully\-featured as in FTS3/4\. However, since FTS5 does provide
an API allowing applications to create [custom auxiliary functions](fts5.html#custom_auxiliary_functions_api_reference), any
required functionality may be implemented within the application code.



 The set of built\-in auxiliary functions provided by FTS5 may be
improved upon in the future.
