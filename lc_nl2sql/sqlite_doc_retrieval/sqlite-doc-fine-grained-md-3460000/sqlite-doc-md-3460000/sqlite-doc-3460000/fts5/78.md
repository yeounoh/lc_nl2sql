### Changes to SELECT statements


1. The "docid" alias does not exist. Applications must use "rowid"
 instead.
2. The behaviour of queries when a column\-filter is specified both as
 part of the FTS query and by using a column as the LHS of a MATCH
 operator is slightly different. For a table with columns "a" and "b"
 and a query similar to:



```
... a MATCH 'b: string'

```

FTS3/4 searches for matches in column "b". However, FTS5 always
 returns zero rows, as results are first filtered for column "b", then
 for column "a", leaving no results. In other words, in FTS3/4 the
 inner filter overrides the outer, in FTS5 both filters are applied.
3. The FTS query syntax (right hand side of the MATCH operator) has
 changed in some ways. The FTS5 syntax is quite close to the FTS4
 "enhanced syntax". The main difference is that FTS5 is fussier
 about unrecognized punctuation characters and similar within query
 strings. Most queries that work with FTS3/4 should also work with
 FTS5, and those that do not should return parse errors.
