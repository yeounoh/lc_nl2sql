## 1\.2\.  Lookup By Rowid



One technique for avoiding a full table scan is to do lookups by
rowid (or by the equivalent [INTEGER PRIMARY KEY](lang_createtable.html#rowid)). To lookup the
price of peaches, one would query for the entry with a rowid of 4:





| ```  SELECT price FROM fruitsforsale WHERE rowid=4;  ``` |
| --- |



Since the information is stored in the table in rowid order, SQLite
can find the correct row using a binary search.
If the table contains N elements, the time required to look up the
desired row is proportional to logN rather than being proportional
to N as in a full table scan. If the table contains 10 million elements,
that means the query will be on the order of N/logN or about 1 million
times faster.
