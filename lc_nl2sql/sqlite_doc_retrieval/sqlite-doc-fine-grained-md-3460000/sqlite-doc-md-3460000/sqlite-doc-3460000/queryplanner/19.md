# 4\.  WITHOUT ROWID tables



The basic principals described above apply to both ordinary rowid tables
and [WITHOUT ROWID](withoutrowid.html) tables.
The only difference is that the rowid column that serves as the key for
tables and that appears as the right\-most term in indexes is replaced by
the PRIMARY KEY.
