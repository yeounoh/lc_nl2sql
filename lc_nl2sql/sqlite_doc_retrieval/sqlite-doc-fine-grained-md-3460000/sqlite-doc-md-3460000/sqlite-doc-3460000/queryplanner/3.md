## 1\.1\.  Tables Without Indices



Most tables in SQLite consist of zero or more rows with a unique integer
key (the [rowid](lang_createtable.html#rowid) or [INTEGER PRIMARY KEY](lang_createtable.html#rowid)) followed by content. 
(The exception is [WITHOUT ROWID](withoutrowid.html) tables.)
The rows
are logically stored in order of increasing rowid. As an example, this
article uses a table named "FruitsForSale" which relates various fruits 
to the state
where they are grown and their unit price at market. The schema is this:





| ```  CREATE TABLE FruitsForSale(   Fruit TEXT,   State TEXT,   Price REAL );  ``` |
| --- |



With some (arbitrary) data, such a table might be logically stored on disk
as shown in figure 1:

In this example, the rowids are not
consecutive but they are ordered. SQLite usually creates rowids beginning
with one and increasing by one with each added row. But if rows are 
deleted, gaps can appear in the sequence. And the application can control
the rowid assigned if desired, so that rows are not necessarily inserted 
at the bottom. But regardless of what happens, the rowids are always 
unique and in strictly ascending order.




Suppose you want to look up the price of peaches. The query would
be as follows:





| ```  SELECT price FROM fruitsforsale WHERE fruit='Peach';  ``` |
| --- |



To satisfy this query, SQLite reads every row out of the
table, checks to see if the "fruit" column has the value of "Peach" and if
so, outputs the "price" column from that row. The process is illustrated
by [figure 2](#fig2) below.
This is algorithm is called a *full table scan* 
since the entire content of the
table must be read and examined in order to find the one row of interest.
With a table of only 7 rows, a full table scan is acceptable, 
but if the table contained 7 million rows, a full table scan might read 
megabytes of content in order to find a single 8\-byte number. 
For that reason, one normally tries to avoid full table scans.
