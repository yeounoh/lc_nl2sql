## 2\.1\.  Sorting By Rowid



Because sorting can be expensive, SQLite works hard to convert ORDER BY
clauses into no\-ops. If SQLite determines that output will
naturally appear in the order specified, then no sorting is done.
So, for example, if you request the output in rowid order, no sorting
will be done:





| ```  SELECT * FROM fruitsforsale ORDER BY rowid;  ``` |
| --- |

You can also request a reverse\-order sort like this:





| ```  SELECT * FROM fruitsforsale ORDER BY rowid DESC;  ``` |
| --- |



SQLite will still omit the sorting step. But in order for output to
appear in the correct order, SQLite will do the table scan starting at
the end and working toward the beginning, rather than starting at the
beginning and working toward the end as shown in 
[figure 17](#fig17).
