## 2\.1\. Read transactions versus write transactions


SQLite supports multiple simultaneous read transactions
coming from separate database connections, possibly in separate
threads or processes, but only one simultaneous write transaction.





A read transaction is used for reading only. A write transaction
allows both reading and writing. A read transaction is started
by a SELECT statement, and a write transaction is started by
statements like CREATE, DELETE, DROP, INSERT, or UPDATE (collectively
"write statements"). If a write statement occurs while
a read transaction is active, then the read transaction is upgraded
to a write transaction if possible. If some other database connection
has already modified the database or is already in the process of
modifying the database, then upgrading to a write transaction is
not possible and the write statement will fail with [SQLITE\_BUSY](rescode.html#busy).




While a read transaction is active, any changes to the database that
are implemented by separate database connections will not be seen
by the database connection that started the read transaction. If database
connection X is holding a read transaction, it is possible that some
other database connection Y might change the content of the database
while X's transaction is still open, however X will not be able to see
those changes until after the transaction ends. While its read
transaction is active, X will continue to see an historic snapshot of
the database prior to the changes implemented by Y.
