## Object\-Oriented Design



This design note considers the database to be a collection of objects.
Each SQL table is a class.
Each row is an instance of that class.
There are, of course, other ways to interpret an SQL database schema,
and the techniques described here work equally well under alternative
interpretations, but an object\-oriented view seems be more natural
to most contemporary programmers.
