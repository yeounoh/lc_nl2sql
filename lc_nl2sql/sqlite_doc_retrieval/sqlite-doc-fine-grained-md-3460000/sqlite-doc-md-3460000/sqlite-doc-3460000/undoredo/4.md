## Automatic Creation Of Triggers



Triggers such as the above could be entered manually, but that is tedious.
An important feature of the technique demonstrated below is 
that the triggers are generated automatically.


The implementation language for the example code is 
[TCL](http://www.tcl-lang.org), though you can easily do the same thing 
in another programming language.
Remember that the code here is a demonstration of the technique,
not a drop\-in module that will automatically do everything for you.
The demonstration code shown below is derived from actual code 
in production use. But you will need to make changes to tailor it 
to your application.


To activate the undo/redo logic, invoke the undo::activate command 
with all classes (tables) that are to participate in the undo/redo 
as arguments. Use undo::deactivate, undo::freeze, and undo::unfreeze 
to control the state of the undo/redo mechanism.


The undo::activate command creates temporary triggers in the database
that record all changes made to the tables named in the arguments.
