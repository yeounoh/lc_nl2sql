# 1\. Overview


The **dbhash** (or **dbhash.exe** on Windows) utility is a
command\-line program that computes the SHA1 hash of the schema and content 
for an SQLite database.



Dbhash ignores extraneous formatting details and hashes only the database
schema and content. Hence the hash is constant even if the database file
is modified by:



* [VACUUM](lang_vacuum.html)
* [PRAGMA page\_size](pragma.html#pragma_page_size)
* [PRAGMA journal\_mode](pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode)
* [REINDEX](lang_reindex.html)
* [ANALYZE](lang_analyze.html)
* copied via the [backup API](backup.html)
* ... and so forth


The operations above can potentially cause vast changes the raw database file,
and hence cause very different SHA1 hashes at the file level.
But since the content represented in the database file is unchanged by these
operations, the hash computed by dbhash is also unchanged.



Dbhash can be used to compare two databases to confirm that they
are equivalent, even though their representation on disk is quite different.
Dbhash might also be used to verify the content of a remote database without having
to transmit the entire content of the remote database over a slow link.
