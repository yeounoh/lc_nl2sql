# 2\. Usage


Dbhash is a command\-line utility.
To run it, type "dbhash" on a command\-line prompt followed by the names of
one or more SQLite database files that are to be hashed.
The database hashes will be displayed on standard output.
For example:




```
drh@bella:~/sqlite/bld$ dbhash ~/Fossils/sqlite.fossil
8d3da9ff87196312aaa33076627ccb7943ef79e3 /home/drh/Fossils/sqlite.fossil

```

Dbhash supports command\-line options that can restrict the tables of the
database file that are hashed, or restrict the hash to only content or only
the schema. Run "dbhash \-\-help" for further information.
