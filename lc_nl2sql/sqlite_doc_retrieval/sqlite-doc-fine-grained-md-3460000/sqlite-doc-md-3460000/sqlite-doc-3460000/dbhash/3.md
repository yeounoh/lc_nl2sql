# 3\. Building


To build a copy of the dbhash utility program on unix, get a copy of the
canonical SQLite source code and enter:




```
./configure
make dbhash

```

On Windows, enter:




```
nmake /f makefile.msc dbhash.exe

```

The dbhash program is implemented by a single file of C\-code
called [dbhash.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/artifact?ci=trunk&filename=tool/dbhash.c).
To build the dbhash program manually, simply compile the dbhash.c source file
and link it against the SQLite library.
