 The ANALYZE command gathers statistics about tables and
indices and stores the collected information
in [internal tables](fileformat2.html#intschema) of the database where the query optimizer can
access the information and use it to help make better query planning choices.
If no arguments are given, the main database and all attached databases are
analyzed. If a schema name is given as the argument, then all tables
and indices in that one database are analyzed. 
If the argument is a table name, then only that table and the
indices associated with that table are analyzed. If the argument
is an index name, then only that one index is analyzed.
