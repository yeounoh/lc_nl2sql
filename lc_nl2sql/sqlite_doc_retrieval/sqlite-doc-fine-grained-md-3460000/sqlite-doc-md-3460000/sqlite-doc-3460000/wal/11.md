# 5\. Read\-Only Databases


Older versions of SQLite could not read a WAL\-mode database that was
read\-only. In other words, write access was required in order to read a
WAL\-mode database. This constraint was relaxed beginning with
SQLite [version 3\.22\.0](releaselog/3_22_0.html) (2018\-01\-22\).



On newer versions of SQLite,
a WAL\-mode database on read\-only media, or a WAL\-mode database that lacks
write permission, can still be read as long as one or more of the following
conditions are met:


1. The \-shm and \-wal files already exists and are readable
2. There is write permission on the directory containing the database so
 that the \-shm and \-wal files can be created.
3. The database connection is opened using the
 [immutable query parameter](uri.html#uriimmutable).


Even though it is possible to open a read\-only WAL\-mode database,
it is good practice to converted to 
[PRAGMA journal\_mode\=DELETE](pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode) prior to burning an
SQLite database image onto read\-only media.
