# 3\. Activating And Configuring WAL Mode


An SQLite database connection defaults to 
[journal\_mode\=DELETE](pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode). To convert to WAL mode, use the
following pragma:



> ```
> 
> PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;
> 
> ```


The journal\_mode pragma returns a string which is the new journal mode.
On success, the pragma will return the string "wal". If 
the conversion to WAL could not be completed (for example, if the [VFS](vfs.html)
does not support the necessary shared\-memory primitives) then the
journaling mode will be unchanged and the string returned from the
primitive will be the prior journaling mode (for example "delete").
