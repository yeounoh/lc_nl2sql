## 2\.1\. Checkpointing


Of course, one wants to eventually transfer all the transactions that
are appended in the WAL file back into the original database. Moving
the WAL file transactions back into the database is called a
"*checkpoint*".




Another way to think about the difference between rollback and 
write\-ahead log is that in the rollback\-journal
approach, there are two primitive operations, reading and writing,
whereas with a write\-ahead log
there are now three primitive operations: reading, writing, and
checkpointing.


By default, SQLite does a checkpoint automatically when the WAL file
reaches a threshold size of 1000 pages. (The
[SQLITE\_DEFAULT\_WAL\_AUTOCHECKPOINT](compile.html#default_wal_autocheckpoint) compile\-time option can be used to
specify a different default.) Applications using WAL do
not have to do anything in order to for these checkpoints to occur. 
But if they want to, applications can adjust the automatic checkpoint
threshold. Or they can turn off the automatic checkpoints and run 
checkpoints during idle moments or in a separate thread or process.
