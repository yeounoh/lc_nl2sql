## 3\.2\. Application\-Initiated Checkpoints


An application can initiate a checkpoint using any writable database
connection on the database simply by invoking
[sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint()](c3ref/wal_checkpoint.html) or [sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint\_v2()](c3ref/wal_checkpoint_v2.html).
There are three subtypes of checkpoints that vary in their aggressiveness:
PASSIVE, FULL, and RESTART. The default checkpoint style is PASSIVE, which
does as much work as it can without interfering with other database
connections, and which might not run to completion if there are
concurrent readers or writers.
All checkpoints initiated by [sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint()](c3ref/wal_checkpoint.html) and
by the automatic checkpoint mechanism are PASSIVE. FULL and RESTART
checkpoints try harder to run the checkpoint to completion and can only
be initiated by a call to [sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint\_v2()](c3ref/wal_checkpoint_v2.html). See the
[sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint\_v2()](c3ref/wal_checkpoint_v2.html) documentation for additional information
on FULL and RESET checkpoints.
