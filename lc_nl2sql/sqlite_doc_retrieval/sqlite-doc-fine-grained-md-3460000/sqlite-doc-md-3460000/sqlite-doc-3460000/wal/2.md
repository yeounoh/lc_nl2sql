# 2\. How WAL Works


The traditional rollback journal works by writing a copy of the
original unchanged database content into a separate rollback journal file
and then writing changes directly into the database file. In the
event of a crash or [ROLLBACK](lang_transaction.html), the original content contained in the
rollback journal is played back into the database file to
revert the database file to its original state. The [COMMIT](lang_transaction.html) occurs
when the rollback journal is deleted.


The WAL approach inverts this. The original content is preserved
in the database file and the changes are appended into a separate
WAL file. A [COMMIT](lang_transaction.html) occurs when a special record indicating a commit
is appended to the WAL. Thus a COMMIT can happen without ever writing
to the original database, which allows readers to continue operating
from the original unaltered database while changes are simultaneously being
committed into the WAL. Multiple transactions can be appended to the
end of a single WAL file.
