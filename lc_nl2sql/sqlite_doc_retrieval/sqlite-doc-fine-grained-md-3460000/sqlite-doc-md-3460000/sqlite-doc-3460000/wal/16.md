# 10\. Backwards Compatibility


The database file format is unchanged for WAL mode. However, the
WAL file and the [wal\-index](walformat.html#shm) are new concepts and so older versions of 
SQLite will not know
how to recover a crashed SQLite database that was operating in WAL mode
when the crash occurred.
To prevent older versions of SQLite (prior to version 3\.7\.0, 2010\-07\-22\)
from trying to recover
a WAL\-mode database (and making matters worse) the database file format
version numbers (bytes 18 and 19 in the [database header](fileformat2.html#database_header))
are increased from 1 to 2 in WAL mode.
Thus, if an older version of SQLite attempts to connect to an SQLite
database that is operating in WAL mode, it will report an error along
the lines of "file is encrypted or is not a database".


One can explicitly change out of WAL mode using a pragma such as
this:



> ```
> 
> PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE;
> 
> ```


Deliberately changing out of WAL mode changes the database file format
version numbers back to 1 so that older versions of SQLite can once again 
access the database file.
