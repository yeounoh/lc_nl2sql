## 3\.3\. Persistence of WAL mode


Unlike the other journaling modes, 
[PRAGMA journal\_mode\=WAL](pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode) is
persistent. If a process sets WAL mode, then closes and reopens the
database, the database will come back in WAL mode. In contrast, if
a process sets (for example) PRAGMA journal\_mode\=TRUNCATE and then closes and
reopens the database will come back up in the default rollback mode of
DELETE rather than the previous TRUNCATE setting.


The persistence of WAL mode means that applications can be converted
to using SQLite in WAL mode without making any changes to the application
itself. One has merely to run "PRAGMA journal\_mode\=WAL;" on the
database file(s) using the [command\-line shell](cli.html) or other utility, then
restart the application.


The WAL journal mode will be set on all
connections to the same database file if it is set on any one connection.
