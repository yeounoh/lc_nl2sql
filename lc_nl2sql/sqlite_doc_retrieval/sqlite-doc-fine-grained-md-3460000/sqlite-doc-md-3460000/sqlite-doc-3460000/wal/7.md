## 3\.1\. Automatic Checkpoint


By default, SQLite will automatically checkpoint whenever a [COMMIT](lang_transaction.html)
occurs that causes the WAL file to be 1000 pages or more in size, or when the 
last database connection on a database file closes. The default 
configuration is intended to work well for most applications.
But programs that want more control can force a checkpoint
using the [wal\_checkpoint pragma](pragma.html#pragma_wal_checkpoint) or by calling the
[sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint()](c3ref/wal_checkpoint.html) C interface. The automatic checkpoint
threshold can be changed or automatic checkpointing can be completely
disabled using the [wal\_autocheckpoint pragma](pragma.html#pragma_wal_autocheckpoint) or by calling the
[sqlite3\_wal\_autocheckpoint()](c3ref/wal_autocheckpoint.html) C interface. A program can also 
use [sqlite3\_wal\_hook()](c3ref/wal_hook.html) to register a callback to be invoked whenever
any transaction commits to the WAL. This callback can then invoke
[sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint()](c3ref/wal_checkpoint.html) or [sqlite3\_wal\_checkpoint\_v2()](c3ref/wal_checkpoint_v2.html) based on whatever
criteria it thinks is appropriate. (The automatic checkpoint mechanism
is implemented as a simple wrapper around [sqlite3\_wal\_hook()](c3ref/wal_hook.html).)
