### The "timeout" method


The "timeout" method is used to control how long the SQLite library
will wait for locks to clear before giving up on a database transaction.
The default timeout is 0 millisecond. (In other words, the default behavior
is not to wait at all.)


The SQLite database allows multiple simultaneous
readers or a single writer but not both. If any process is writing to
the database no other process is allows to read or write. If any process
is reading the database other processes are allowed to read but not write.
The entire database shared a single lock.


When SQLite tries to open a database and finds that it is locked, it
can optionally delay for a short while and try to open the file again.
This process repeats until the query times out and SQLite returns a
failure. The timeout is adjustable. It is set to 0 by default so that
if the database is locked, the SQL statement fails immediately. But you
can use the "timeout" method to change the timeout value to a positive
number. For example:



> **db1 timeout 2000**


The argument to the timeout method is the maximum number of milliseconds
to wait for the lock to clear. So in the example above, the maximum delay
would be 2 seconds.
