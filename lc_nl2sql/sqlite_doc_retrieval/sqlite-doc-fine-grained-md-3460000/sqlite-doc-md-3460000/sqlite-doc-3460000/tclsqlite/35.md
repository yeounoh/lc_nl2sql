### The "backup" method


The "backup" method makes a backup copy of a live database. The
command syntax is like this:



> *dbcmd*  **backup**  ?*source\-database*?  *backup\-filename*


The optional *source\-database* argument tells which database in
the current connection should be backed up. The default value is **main**
(or, in other words, the primary database file). To back up TEMP tables
use **temp**. To backup an auxiliary database added to the connection
using the [ATTACH](lang_attach.html) command, use the name of that database as it was assigned
in the [ATTACH](lang_attach.html) command.


The *backup\-filename* is the name of a file into which the backup is
written. *Backup\-filename* does not have to exist ahead of time, but if
it does, it must be a well\-formed SQLite database.
