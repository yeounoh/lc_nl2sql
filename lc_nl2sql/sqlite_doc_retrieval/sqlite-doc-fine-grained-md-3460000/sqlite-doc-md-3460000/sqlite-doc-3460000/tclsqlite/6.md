### The "cache" method



The "eval" method described [above](#eval) keeps a cache of
[prepared statements](c3ref/prepare.html)
for recently evaluated SQL commands.
The "cache" method is used to control this cache.
The first form of this command is:



> *dbcmd*  **cache size**  *N*


This sets the maximum number of statements that can be cached.
The upper limit is 100\. The default is 10\. If you set the cache size
to 0, no caching is done.


The second form of the command is this:



> *dbcmd*  **cache flush**


The cache\-flush method
[finalizes](c3ref/finalize.html)
all prepared statements currently
in the cache.
