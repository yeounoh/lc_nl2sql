### The "onecolumn" method


The "onecolumn" method works like
"[eval](#eval)" in that it evaluates the
SQL query statement given as its argument. The difference is that
"onecolumn" returns a single element which is the first column of the
first row of the query result.


This is a convenience method. It saves the user from having to
do a "\[lindex ... 0]" on the results of an "eval"
in order to extract a single column result.
