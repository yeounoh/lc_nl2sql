### The "progress" method


This method registers a callback that is invoked periodically during
query processing. There are two arguments: the number of SQLite virtual
machine opcodes between invocations, and the TCL command to invoke.
Setting the progress callback to an empty string disables it.


The progress callback can be used to display the status of a lengthy
query or to process GUI events during a lengthy query.
