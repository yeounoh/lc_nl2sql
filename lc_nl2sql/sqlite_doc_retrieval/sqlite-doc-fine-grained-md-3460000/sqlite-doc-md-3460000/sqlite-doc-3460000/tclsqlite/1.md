# The Tcl interface to the SQLite library


The SQLite library is designed to be very easy to use from
a [Tcl or Tcl/Tk](http://www.tcl-lang.org) script. SQLite
began as a [Tcl extension](http://www.tcl-lang.org/doc/tea/)
and the primary [test suite](testing.html) for SQLite is written in TCL. SQLite
can be used with any programming language, but its connections to
TCL run deep.


This document gives an overview of the Tcl
programming interface for SQLite.
