### The "restore" method


The "restore" method copies the content from a separate database file
into the current database connection, overwriting any preexisting content.
The command syntax is like this:



> *dbcmd*  **restore**  ?*target\-database*?  *source\-filename*


The optional *target\-database* argument tells which database in
the current connection should be overwritten with new content.
The default value is **main**
(or, in other words, the primary database file). To repopulate the TEMP tables
use **temp**. To overwrite an auxiliary database added to the connection
using the [ATTACH](lang_attach.html) command, use the name of that database as it was assigned
in the [ATTACH](lang_attach.html) command.


The *source\-filename* is the name of an existing well\-formed SQLite
database file from which the content is extracted.
