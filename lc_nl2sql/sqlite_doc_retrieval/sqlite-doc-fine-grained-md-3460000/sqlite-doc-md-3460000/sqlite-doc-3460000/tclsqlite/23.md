### The "collate" method


This method registers new text collating sequences. There are
two arguments: the name of the collating sequence and the name of a
TCL procedure that implements a comparison function for the collating
sequence.



For example, the following code implements a collating sequence called
"NOCASE" that sorts in text order without regard to case:




> ```
> 
> proc nocase_compare {a b} {
>   return [string compare [string tolower $a] [string tolower $b]]
> }
> db collate NOCASE nocase_compare
> 
> ```
