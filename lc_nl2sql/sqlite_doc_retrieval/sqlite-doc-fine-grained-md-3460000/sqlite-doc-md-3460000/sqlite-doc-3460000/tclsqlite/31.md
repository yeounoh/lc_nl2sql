### The "incrblob" method


This method opens a TCL channel that can be used to read or write
into a preexisting BLOB in the database. The syntax is like this:



> *dbcmd*  **incrblob**  **?\-readonly?**
>   *?DB?  TABLE  COLUMN  ROWID*



The command returns a new TCL channel for reading or writing to the BLOB.
The channel is opened using the underlying
[sqlite3\_blob\_open()](c3ref/blob_open.html) C\-language
interface. Close the channel using the **close** command of TCL.
