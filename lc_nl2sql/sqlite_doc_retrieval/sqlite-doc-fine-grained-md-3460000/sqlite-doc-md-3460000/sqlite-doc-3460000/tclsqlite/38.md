### The "deserialize" method


The "deserialize" method takes a TCL byte\-array that contains an SQLite
database file and adds it to the database connection. The syntax is:


> *dbcmd*  **deserialize**  ?*database*?  *value*


The option *database* argument identifies which attached database
should receive the deserialization. The default is "main".

This command causes SQLite to disconnect from the previous database and
reattach to an in\-memory database with the content in *value*. If *value*
is not a byte\-array containing a well\-defined SQLite database, then subsequent
commands will likely return [SQLITE\_CORRUPT](rescode.html#corrupt) errors.

This method only functions if SQLite is compiled with \-DSQLITE\_ENABLE\_DESERIALIZE
