### The "serialize" method


The "serialize" method creates a BLOB which is a complete copy of an
underlying database. The syntax is like this:


> *dbcmd*  **serialize**  ?*database*?


The optional argument is the name of the schema or database to be serialized.
The default value is "main".

This routine returns a TCL byte\-array that is the complete content of
the identified database. This byte\-array can be written into a file and
then used as an ordinary SQLite database, or it can be sent over a TCP/IP
connection to some other application, or passed to the "deserialize" method
of another database connection.

This method only functions if SQLite is compiled with \-DSQLITE\_ENABLE\_DESERIALIZE
