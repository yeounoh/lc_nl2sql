### The "exists" method


The "exists" method is similar to "onecolumn" and "eval" in that
it executes SQL statements. The difference is that the "exists" method
always returns a boolean value which is TRUE if a query in the SQL
statement it executes returns one or more rows and FALSE if the SQL
returns an empty set.


The "exists" method is often used to test for the existence of
rows in a table. For example:



> **if {\[db exists {SELECT 1 FROM table1 WHERE user\=$user}]} {  
> 
>    \# Processing if $user exists  
> 
> } else {  
> 
>    \# Processing if $user does not exist  
> 
> }**
