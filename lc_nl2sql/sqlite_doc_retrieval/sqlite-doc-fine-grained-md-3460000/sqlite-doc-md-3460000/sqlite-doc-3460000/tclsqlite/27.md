### The "status" method


This method returns status information from the most recently evaluated
SQL statement. The status method takes a single argument which should be
either "steps" or "sorts". If the argument is "steps", then the method
returns the number of full table scan steps that the previous SQL statement
evaluated. If the argument is "sorts", the method returns the number of
sort operations. This information can be used to detect queries that are
not using indices to speed search or sorting.


The status method is basically a wrapper on the
[sqlite3\_stmt\_status()](c3ref/stmt_status.html) C\-language interface.
