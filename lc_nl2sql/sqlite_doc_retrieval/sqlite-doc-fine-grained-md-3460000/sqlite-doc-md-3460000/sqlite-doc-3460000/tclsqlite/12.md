### The "enable\_load\_extension" method


The extension loading mechanism of SQLite (accessed using the
[load\_extension()](lang_corefunc.html#load_extension) SQL function) is turned off by default. This is
a security precaution. If an application wants to make use of the
[load\_extension()](lang_corefunc.html#load_extension) function it must first turn the capability on using
this method.


This method takes a single boolean argument which will turn the
extension loading functionality on or off.


For best security, do not use this method unless truly needed,
and run [PRAGMA trusted\_schema\=OFF](pragma.html#pragma_trusted_schema) or the
"[db config trusted\_schema 0](#config)" method before
invoking this method.

This method maps to the [sqlite3\_enable\_load\_extension()](c3ref/enable_load_extension.html) C/C\+\+
interface.
