### The "authorizer" method


The "authorizer" method provides access to the
[sqlite3\_set\_authorizer](c3ref/set_authorizer.html)
C/C\+\+ interface. The argument to authorizer is the name of a procedure that
is called when SQL statements are being compiled in order to authorize
certain operations. The callback procedure takes 5 arguments which describe
the operation being coded. If the callback returns the text string
"SQLITE\_OK", then the operation is allowed. If it returns "SQLITE\_IGNORE",
then the operation is silently disabled. If the return is "SQLITE\_DENY"
then the compilation fails with an error.



If the argument is an empty string then the authorizer is disabled.
If the argument is omitted, then the current authorizer is returned.
