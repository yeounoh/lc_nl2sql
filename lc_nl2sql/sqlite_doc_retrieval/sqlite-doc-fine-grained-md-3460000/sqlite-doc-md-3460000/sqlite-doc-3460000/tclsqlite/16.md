### The "nullvalue" method



The "nullvalue" method changes the representation for NULL returned
as result of the "eval" method.



> **db1 nullvalue NULL**


The "nullvalue" method is useful to differ between NULL and empty
column values as Tcl lacks a NULL representation. The default
representation for NULL values is an empty string.
