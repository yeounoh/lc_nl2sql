### The "close" method



As its name suggests, the "close" method to an SQLite database just
closes the database. This has the side\-effect of deleting the
*dbcmd* Tcl command. Here is an example of opening and then
immediately closing a database:




> **sqlite3 db1 ./testdb  
> 
> db1 close**



If you delete the *dbcmd* directly, that has the same effect
as invoking the "close" method. So the following code is equivalent
to the previous:



> **sqlite3 db1 ./testdb  
> 
> rename db1 {}**
