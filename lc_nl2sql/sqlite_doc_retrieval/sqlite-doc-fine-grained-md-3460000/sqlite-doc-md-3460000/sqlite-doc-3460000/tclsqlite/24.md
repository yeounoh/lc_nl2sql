### The "collation\_needed" method


This method registers a callback routine that is invoked when the SQLite
engine needs a particular collating sequence but does not have that
collating sequence registered. The callback can register the collating
sequence. The callback is invoked with a single parameter which is the
name of the needed collating sequence.
