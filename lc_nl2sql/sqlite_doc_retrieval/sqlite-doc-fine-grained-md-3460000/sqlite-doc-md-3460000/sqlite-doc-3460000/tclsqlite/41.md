### The "profile" method


This method is used to profile the execution of SQL statements run by
 the application. The syntax is as follows:




> *dbcmd*  **profile**  ?*script*?


Unless *script* is an empty string, this method arranges for the
*script* to be evaluated after the execution of each SQL statement.
Two arguments are appended to *script* before it is invoked: the
text of the SQL statement executed and the time elapsed while executing
the statement, in nanoseconds.



A database handle may only have a single profile script registered at
any time. If there is already a script registered when the profile method
is invoked, the previous profile script is replaced by the new one. If the
*script* argument is an empty string, any previously registered
profile callback is canceled but no new profile script is registered.
