### The "update\_hook" method


This method registers a callback routine that is invoked just after
each row is modified by an UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE statement. Four
arguments are appended to the callback before it is invoked:


* The keyword "INSERT", "UPDATE", or "DELETE", as appropriate
* The name of the database which is being changed
* The table that is being changed
* The rowid of the row in the table being changed


The callback must not do anything that will modify the database connection
that invoked the update hook such as running queries.
