### The "busy" method


The "busy" method, like "timeout", only comes into play when the
database is locked. But the "busy" method gives the programmer much more
control over what action to take. The "busy" method specifies a callback
Tcl procedure that is invoked whenever SQLite tries to open a locked
database. A single integer argument is appended to the callback before
it is invoke. The argument is the number of prior calls to the busy
callback for the current locking event. It is intended that
the callback will do some other useful work for a short while
(such as service GUI events) then return
so that the lock can be tried again. The callback procedure should
return "0" if it wants SQLite to try again to open the database and
should return "1" if it wants SQLite to abandon the current operation.

If the busy method is invoked without an argument, the name of the callback
procedure last set by the busy method is returned. If no callback procedure
has been set, an empty string is returned.
