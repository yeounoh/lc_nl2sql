# 5\.  Memory corruption


SQLite is a C\-library that runs in the same address space as the 
application that it serves. That means that stray pointers, buffer
overruns, heap corruption, or other malfunctions in the application can
corrupt internal SQLite data structure and ultimately result in a
corrupt database file. Normally these kinds of problems manifest themselves
as segfaults prior to any database corruption occurring, but there have
been instances where application code errors have caused SQLite to
malfunction subtly so as to corrupt the database file rather than
panicking.


The memory corruption problem becomes more acute when
using [memory\-mapped I/O](mmap.html).
When all or part of the database file is mapped into the application's
address space, then a stray pointer that overwrites any part of that
mapped space will immediately corrupt the database file, without
requiring the application to do a subsequent write() system call.
