## 8\.4\.  Database pages leak from the free page list


When content is deleted from an SQLite database, pages that are no
longer used are added to a free list and are reused to hold content
added by subsequent inserts. A bug in SQLite that was present in
version 3\.6\.16 through 3\.7\.2 might cause pages to go missing out of
the free list when [incremental\_vacuum](pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum) was used. This would not cause
data loss. But it would result in the database file being larger than
necessary. And it would cause the [integrity\_check pragma](pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check) to report
pages missing from the free list.


This problem was fixed on 2010\-08\-23 for SQLite version 3\.7\.2\.
