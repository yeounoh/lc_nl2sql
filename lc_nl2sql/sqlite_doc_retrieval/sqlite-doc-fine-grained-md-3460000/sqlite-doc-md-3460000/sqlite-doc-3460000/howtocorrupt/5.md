## 1\.3\.  Deleting a hot journal


SQLite normally stores all content in a single disk file. However,
while performing a transaction, information necessary to recover the
database following a crash or power failure is stored in auxiliary
journal files. Such journal files are described as ["hot"](fileformat2.html#hotjrnl).
The journal files have the same name as the
original database file with the addition
of \-journal or \-wal suffix.


SQLite must see the journal files in order to recover from a crash
or power failure. If the [hot journal files](fileformat2.html#hotjrnl) are moved, deleted, or renamed
after a crash or power failure, then automatic recovery will not work
and the database may go corrupt.


Another manifestation of this problem is
[database corruption caused by inconsistent use of 8\+3 filenames](shortnames.html#db83corrupt).
