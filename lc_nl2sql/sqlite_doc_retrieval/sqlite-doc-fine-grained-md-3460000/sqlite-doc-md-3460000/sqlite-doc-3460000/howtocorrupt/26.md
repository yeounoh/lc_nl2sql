# 7\. SQLite Configuration Errors


SQLite has many built\-in protections against database corruption.
But many of these protections can be disabled by configuration options.
If protections are disabled, database corruption may occur.



The following are examples of disabling the built\-in protection
mechanisms of SQLite:



* Setting [PRAGMA synchronous\=OFF](pragma.html#pragma_synchronous) can cause the database to
go corrupt if there is an operating\-system crash or power failure,
though this setting is safe from damage due to application crashes.
* Changing the [PRAGMA schema\_version](pragma.html#pragma_schema_version) while other database
connections are open.
* Using [PRAGMA journal\_mode\=OFF](pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode) or [PRAGMA journal\_mode\=MEMORY](pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode)
and taking an application crash in the middle of a write transaction.
* Setting [PRAGMA writable\_schema\=ON](pragma.html#pragma_writable_schema) and then changing the
database schema using DML statements can render the database completely
unreadable, if not done carefully.
