## 8\.1\.  False corruption reports due to database shrinkage


If a database is written by SQLite version 3\.7\.0 or later and then
written again by SQLite version 3\.6\.23 or earlier in such a way as to
make the size of the database file decrease, then the next time that
SQLite version 3\.7\.0 access the database file, it might report that the
database file is corrupt. The database file is not really corrupt, however.
Version 3\.7\.0 was simply being overly zealous in its corruption detection.


The problem was fixed on 2011\-02\-20\. The fix first appears in
SQLite [version 3\.7\.6](releaselog/3_7_6.html) (2011\-04\-12\).
