# 8\.  Bugs in SQLite


SQLite is [very carefully tested](testing.html) to help ensure that it is
as bug\-free as possible. Among the many tests that are carried out for
every SQLite version are tests that simulate power failures, I/O errors,
and out\-of\-memory (OOM) errors and verify that no database corruption occurs
during any of these events. SQLite is also field\-proven with approximately
two billion active deployments with no serious problems.


Nevertheless, no software is 100% perfect. There have been a few
historical bugs in SQLite (now fixed) that could cause database corruption.
And there may be yet a few more that remain undiscovered. Because of the
extensive testing and widespread use of SQLite, bugs that result in
database corruption tend to be very obscure. The likelihood
of an application encountering an SQLite bug is small. To illustrate this,
an account is given below 
of all database\-corruption bugs found in SQLite during the
four\-year period from 2009\-04\-01 to 2013\-04\-15\.
This account should give the reader an intuitive sense of the
kinds of bugs in SQLite that manage to slip through testing procedures
and make it into a release.
