## 2\.5\.  Multiple links to the same file


If a single database file has multiple links (either hard or soft links)
then that is just another way of saying that the file has multiple names.
If two or more processes open the database using different names, then
they will use different rollback journals and WAL files. That means that
if one process crashes, the other process will be unable to recover the
transaction in progress because it will be looking in the wrong place
for the appropriate journal.


In other words, opening and using a database file that has two or
more names results in behavior that is undefined and probably undesirable.


Beginning with SQLite [version 3\.7\.17](releaselog/3_7_17.html) (2013\-05\-20\),
the unix OS interface will
send SQLITE\_WARNING messages to the [error log](errlog.html) if a database file has 
multiple hard links.


Beginning with SQLite [version 3\.10\.0](releaselog/3_10_0.html) (2016\-01\-06\), 
the unix OS interface will
attempt to resolve symbolic links and open the database file by its
canonical name. Prior to version 3\.10\.0, opening a database file 
through a symbolic link was similar to opening a database file
that had multiple hard links and resulted in undefined behavior.
