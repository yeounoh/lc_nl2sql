## 2\.6\.  Carrying an open database connection across a fork()


 Do not open an SQLite database connection, then fork(), then try
to use that database connection in the child process. All kinds of
locking problems will result and you can easily end up with a corrupt
database. SQLite is not designed to support that kind of behavior.
Any database connection that is used in a child process must be opened
in the child process, not inherited from the parent.



 Do not even call [sqlite3\_close()](c3ref/close.html) on a database connection from a
child process if the connection was opened in the parent. It is safe
to close the underlying file descriptor, but the [sqlite3\_close()](c3ref/close.html)
interface might invoke cleanup activities that will delete content out
from under the parent, leading to errors and perhaps even database
corruption.
