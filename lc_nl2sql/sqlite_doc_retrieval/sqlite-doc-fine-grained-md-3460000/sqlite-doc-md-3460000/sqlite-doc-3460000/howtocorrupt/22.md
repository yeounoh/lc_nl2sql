# 6\.  Other operating system problems


Sometimes operating systems will exhibit non\-standard behavior which
can lead to problems. Sometimes this non\-standard behavior is deliberate,
and sometimes it is a mistake in the implementation. But in any event,
if the operating performs differently from they way SQLite expects it to
perform, the possibility of database corruption exists.
