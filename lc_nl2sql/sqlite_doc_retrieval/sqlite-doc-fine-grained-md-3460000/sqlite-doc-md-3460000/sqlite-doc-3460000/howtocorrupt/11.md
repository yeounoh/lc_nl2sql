## 2\.3\.  Two processes using different locking protocols


The default locking mechanism used by SQLite on unix platforms is
POSIX advisory locking, but there are other options. By selecting an
alternative [sqlite3\_vfs](c3ref/vfs.html) using the [sqlite3\_open\_v2()](c3ref/open.html) interface, an
application can make use of other locking protocols that might be more
appropriate to certain filesystems. For example, dot\-file locking might
be select for use in an application that has to run on an NFS filesystem
that does not support POSIX advisory locking.


It is important that all connections to the same database file use 
the same locking protocol.
If one application is using POSIX advisory locks and another application
is using dot\-file locking, then the two applications will not see each
other's locks and will not be able to coordinate database access, possibly
leading to database corruption.
