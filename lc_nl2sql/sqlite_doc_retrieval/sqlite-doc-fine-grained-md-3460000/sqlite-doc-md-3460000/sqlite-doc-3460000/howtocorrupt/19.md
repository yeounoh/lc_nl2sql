## 4\.1\.  Non\-powersafe flash memory controllers


We are told that in some flash memory controllers the wear\-leveling logic
can cause random filesystem damage if power is interrupted during a write.
This can manifest, for example, as random changes in the middle of a file
that was not even open at the time of the power loss. So, for example,
a device would be writing content into an MP3 file in flash memory when a
power loss occurs, and that could result in an SQLite database being
corrupted even though the database was not even in use at the time of the
power loss.
