## 8\.5\.  Corruption following alternating writes from 3\.6 and 3\.7


SQLite version 3\.7\.0 introduced a number of new enhancements to
the SQLite database file format (such as but not limited to [WAL](wal.html)).
The 3\.7\.0 release was a shake\-out release for these new features.
We expected to find problems and were not disappointed.


If a database were originally created using SQLite version 3\.7\.0,
then written by SQLite version 3\.6\.23\.1 such that the size of the database
file increased, then written again by SQLite version 3\.7\.0, the database
file could go corrupt.


This problem was fixed on 2010\-08\-04 for SQLite version 3\.7\.1\.
