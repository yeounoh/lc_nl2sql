## 6\.3\.  Filesystem Corruption


Since SQLite databases are ordinary disk files, any malfunction in the
filesystem can corrupt the database. Filesystems in modern operating systems
are very reliable, but errors do still occur. For example, on 2013\-10\-01
the SQLite database that holds the
[Wiki for Tcl/Tk](http://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) went corrupt a few days
after the host computer was moved to a dodgy build of the (linux) kernel
that had issues in the filesystem layer. In that event, the filesystem
eventually became so badly corrupted that the machine was unusable, but
the earliest symptom of trouble was the corrupted SQLite database.
