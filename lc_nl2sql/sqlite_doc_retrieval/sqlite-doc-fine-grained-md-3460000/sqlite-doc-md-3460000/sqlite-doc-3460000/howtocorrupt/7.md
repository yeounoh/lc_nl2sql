# 2\.  File locking problems


SQLite uses file locks on the database file, and on the 
[write\-ahead log](wal.html) or [WAL](wal.html) file, to coordinate access between concurrent
processes. Without coordination, two threads or processes might try
to make incompatible changes to a database file at the same time,
resulting in database corruption.
