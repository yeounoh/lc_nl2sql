## 1\.4\.  Mispairing database files and hot journals


 The previous example is a specific case of a more general problem:
The state of an SQLite database is controlled by both the
database file and the journal file. In a quiescent state, the journal
file does not exist and only the database file matters.
But if the journal file does exist, it must be
kept together with the database to avoid corruption. The following
actions are all likely to lead to corruption:


* Swapping journal files between two different databases.
* Overwritting a journal file with a different journal file.
* Moving a journal file from one database to another.
* Copying a database file without also copying its journal.
* Overwriting a database file with another without also
 deleting any hot journal associated with the original database.
