## 3\.2\.  Disabling sync using PRAGMAs


The sync operations that SQLite performs to help ensure integrity
can be disabled at run\-time using the [synchronous pragma](pragma.html#pragma_synchronous). By setting
PRAGMA synchronous\=OFF, all sync operations are omitted. This makes
SQLite seem to run faster, but it also allows the operating system to freely
reorder writes, which could result in database corruption if a power failure
or hard reset occurs prior to all content reaching persistent storage.


For maximum reliability and for robustness against database corruption,
SQLite should always be run with its default synchronous setting of FULL.
