## 6\.1\.  Linux Threads


Some older versions of Linux used the LinuxThreads library for thread
support. LinuxThreads is similar to Pthreads, but is subtly different
with respect to handling of POSIX advisory locks. SQLite versions
2\.2\.3 through 3\.6\.23 recognized that LinuxThreads were being used at
runtime and took appropriate action to work around the non\-standard
behavior of LinuxThreads. But most modern Linux implementations make
use of the newer, and correct, NPTL implementation of Pthreads. Beginning
with SQLite [version 3\.7\.0](releaselog/3_7_0.html) (2010\-07\-21\), the use of NPTL is assumed.
No checks are 
made. Hence, recent versions of SQLite will subtly malfunction and may 
corrupt database files if used in multi\-threaded application that run
on older linux systems that make use of LinuxThreads.
