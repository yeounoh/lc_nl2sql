## 1\.2\.  Backup or restore while a transaction is active


Systems that run automatic backups in the background might try to
make a backup copy of an SQLite database file while it is in the middle
of a transaction. The backup copy then might contain some old and some
new content, and thus be corrupt.


The best approach to make reliable backup copies of an SQLite database
is to make use of the [backup API](backup.html) that is part of the SQLite library.
Failing that, it is safe to make a copy of an SQLite database file as long
as there are no transactions in progress by any process. If the previous
transaction failed, then it is important that any rollback journal
(the \*\-journal file) or write\-ahead log (the \*\-wal file)
be copied together with the database file itself.
