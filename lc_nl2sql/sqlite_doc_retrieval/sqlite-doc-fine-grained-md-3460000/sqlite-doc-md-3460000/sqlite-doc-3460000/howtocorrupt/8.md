## 2\.1\.  Filesystems with broken or missing lock implementations


SQLite depends on the underlying filesystem to do locking as the
documentation says it will. But some filesystems contain bugs in their
locking logic such that the locks do not always behave as advertised.
This is especially true of network filesystems and NFS in particular.
If SQLite is used on a filesystem where the locking primitives contain
bugs, and if two or more threads or processes try to access the same
database at the same time, then database corruption might result.
