## Contributed Code



In order to keep SQLite completely free and unencumbered by copyright,
the project does not accept patches. If you would like to suggest a
change and you include a patch as a proof\-of\-concept, that would
be great. However, please do not be offended if we rewrite your patch
from scratch.
