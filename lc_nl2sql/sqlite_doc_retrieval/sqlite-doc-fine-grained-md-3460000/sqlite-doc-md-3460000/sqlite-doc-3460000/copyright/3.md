## Warranty of Title



SQLite is in the public domain and does not require a license.
Even so, some organizations want legal proof of their right to use
SQLite. Circumstances where this might occur include the following:



* Your company desires indemnity against claims of copyright infringement.
* You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize
 the public domain.
* You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize
 the right of an author to dedicate their work to the public
 domain.
* You want to hold a tangible legal document
 as evidence that you have the legal right to use and distribute
 SQLite.
* Your legal department tells you that you must purchase a license.



If any of the above circumstances apply to you,
[Hwaci](https://www.hwaci.com/), the company that employs 
all the developers of SQLite, will 
[sell you
a Warranty of Title for SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/purchase/license).
A Warranty of Title is a legal document that asserts that the claimed
authors of SQLite are the true authors, and that the authors 
have the legal right to dedicate the SQLite library into the public domain, and 
that Hwaci will vigorously defend against challenges to those claims.
All proceeds from the sale of SQLite Warranties of Title are used to fund
continuing improvement and support of SQLite.
