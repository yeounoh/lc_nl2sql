## Open\-Source, not Open\-Contribution



SQLite is open\-source, meaning that you can make as many copies of it as
you want and do whatever you want with those copies, without limitation.
But SQLite is not open\-contribution. In order to keep SQLite in the public
domain and ensure that the code does not become contaminated with proprietary
or licensed content, the project does not accept patches from people who
have not submitted an affidavit dedicating their contribution into the
public domain.


All of the code in SQLite is original, having been written
specifically for use by SQLite. No code has been copied from unknown
sources on the internet.
