## 1\.5\. Collations


The COLLATE clause optionally following each column name
or expression defines a
collating sequence used for text entries in that column.
The default collating
sequence is the collating sequence defined for that column in the
[CREATE TABLE](lang_createtable.html) statement. Or if no collating sequence is otherwise defined,
the built\-in BINARY collating sequence is used.
