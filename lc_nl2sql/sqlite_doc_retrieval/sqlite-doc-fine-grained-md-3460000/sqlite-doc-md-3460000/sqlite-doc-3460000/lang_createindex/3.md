## 1\.2\. Indexes on Expressions


Expressions in an index may not reference other tables
and may not use subqueries nor functions whose result might
change (ex: [random()](lang_corefunc.html#random) or [sqlite\_version()](lang_corefunc.html#sqlite_version)).
Expressions in an index may only refer to columns in the table
that is being indexed.
Indexes on expression will not work with versions of SQLite prior
to [version 3\.9\.0](releaselog/3_9_0.html) (2015\-10\-14\).
See the [Indexes On Expressions](expridx.html) document for additional information
about using general expressions in CREATE INDEX statements.
