## 1\.1\. Unique Indexes


If the UNIQUE keyword appears between CREATE and INDEX then duplicate
index entries are not allowed. Any attempt to insert a duplicate entry
will result in an error.


For the purposes of unique indices, all NULL values
are considered different from all other NULL values and are thus unique.
This is one of the two possible interpretations of the SQL\-92 standard
(the language in the standard is ambiguous). The interpretation used
by SQLite is the same and is the interpretation
followed by PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebird, and Oracle. Informix and
Microsoft SQL Server follow the other interpretation of the standard, which
is that all NULL values are equal to one another.
