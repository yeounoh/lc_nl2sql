## 1\.3\. Descending Indexes


Each column name or expression can be followed by one
of the "ASC" or "DESC" keywords to indicate sort order.
The sort order may or may not be ignored depending
on the database file format, and in particular the [schema format number](fileformat2.html#schemaformat).
The "legacy" schema format (1\) ignores index
sort order. The descending index schema format (4\) takes index sort order
into account. Only versions of SQLite 3\.3\.0 (2006\-01\-11\)
and later are able to understand
the descending index format. For compatibility, version of SQLite between 3\.3\.0
and 3\.7\.9 use the legacy schema format by default. The newer schema format is
used by default in version 3\.7\.10 (2012\-01\-16\) and later.
The [legacy\_file\_format pragma](pragma.html#pragma_legacy_file_format) can be used to change set the specific
behavior for any version of SQLite.
