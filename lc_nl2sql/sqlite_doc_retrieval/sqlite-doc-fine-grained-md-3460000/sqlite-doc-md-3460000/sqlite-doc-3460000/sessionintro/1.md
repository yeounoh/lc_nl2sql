# 1\. Introduction


The session extension provide a mechanism for conviently recording
changes to some or all of certain tables in an SQLite database, and
packaging those changes into a "changeset" or "patchset" file that can
later be used to apply the same set of changes to another database with
the same schema and compatible starting data. A "changeset" may
also be inverted and used to "undo" a session.



This document is an introduction to the session extension.
The details of the interface are in the separate
[Session Extension C\-language Interface](session/intro.html) document.
