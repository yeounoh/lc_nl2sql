# 4\. Extended Functionality


 Most applications will only use the session module functionality described
in the previous section. However, the following additional functionality is
available for the use and manipulation of changeset and patchset blobs:



* Two or more changeset/patchsets may be combined using the
 [sqlite3changeset\_concat()](session/sqlite3changeset_concat.html) or [sqlite3\_changegroup](session/changegroup.html) interfaces.
* A changeset may be "inverted" using the [sqlite3changeset\_invert()](session/sqlite3changeset_invert.html)
 API function. An inverted changeset undoes the changes made by the
 original. If changeset C\+ is the inverse of changeset C, then
 applying C and then C\+ to a database should leave
 the database unchanged.
