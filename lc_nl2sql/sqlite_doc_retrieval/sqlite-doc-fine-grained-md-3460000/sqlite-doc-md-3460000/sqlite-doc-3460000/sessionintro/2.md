## 1\.1\. Typical Use Case


Suppose SQLite is used as the [application file format](appfileformat.html) for a
particular design application. Two users, Alice and Bob, each start
with a baseline design that is about a gigabyte in size. They work
all day, in parallel, each making their own customizations and tweaks
to the design. At the end of the day, they would like to merge their
changes together into a single unified design.



The session extension facilitates this by recording all changes to
both Alice's and Bob's databases and writing those changes into
changeset or patchset files. At the end of the day, Alice can send her
changeset to Bob and Bob can "apply" it to his database. The result (assuming
there are no conflicts) is that Bob's database then contains both his
changes and Alice's changes. Likewise, Bob can send a changeset of
his work over to Alice and she can apply his changes to her database.



In other words, the session extension provides a facility for
SQLite database files that is similar to the unix
[patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(Unix)) utility program,
or to the "merge" capabilities of version control systems such
as [Fossil](https://www.fossil-scm.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com),
or [Mercurial](http://www.mercurial-scm.org/).
