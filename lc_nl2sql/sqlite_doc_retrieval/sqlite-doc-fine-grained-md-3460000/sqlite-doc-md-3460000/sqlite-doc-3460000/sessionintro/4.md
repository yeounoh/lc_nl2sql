## 1\.3\. Limitations


* Prior to SQLite version 3\.17\.0, the session extension only worked with
 [rowid tables](rowidtable.html), not [WITHOUT ROWID](withoutrowid.html) tables. As of 3\.17\.0, both
 rowid and WITHOUT ROWID tables are supported. However, extra steps are
 needed to record primary keys for WITHOUT ROWID table changes.
* There is no support for [virtual tables](vtab.html). Changes to virtual tables are
 not captured.
* The session extension only works with tables that have a declared
 PRIMARY KEY. The PRIMARY KEY of a table may be an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
 (rowid alias) or an external PRIMARY KEY.
* SQLite allows [NULL values](nulls.html) to be stored in
 PRIMARY KEY columns. However, the session extension ignores all
 such rows. No changes affecting rows with one or more NULL values
 in PRIMARY KEY columns are recorded by the sessions module.
