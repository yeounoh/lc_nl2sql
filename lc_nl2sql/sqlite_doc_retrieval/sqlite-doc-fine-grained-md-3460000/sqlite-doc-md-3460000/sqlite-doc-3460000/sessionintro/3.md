## 1\.2\. Obtaining the Session Extension


 Since [version 3\.13\.0](releaselog/3_13_0.html) (2016\-05\-18\),
the session extension has been included in the SQLite
[amalgamation](amalgamation.html) source distribution. By default, the session extension is
disabled. To enable it, build with the following compiler switches:




```
-DSQLITE_ENABLE_SESSION -DSQLITE_ENABLE_PREUPDATE_HOOK

```

 Or, if using the autoconf build system,
pass the \-\-enable\-session option to the configure script.
