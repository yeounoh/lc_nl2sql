# 6\. TH3 License


SQLite itself is in the [public domain](copyright.html) and
can be used for any purpose. But TH3 is proprietary and requires a license.



Even though open\-source users do not have direct access to TH3, all
users of SQLite benefit from TH3 indirectly since each version of SQLite is
validated running TH3 on multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, WinRT, Mac,
OpenBSD) prior to release. So anyone using an official release
of SQLite can deploy their application with the confidence of knowing that
it has been tested using TH3\. They simply cannot rerun those tests
themselves without purchasing a TH3 license.
