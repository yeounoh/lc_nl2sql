# 1\. Overview


SQLite Test Harness \#3 (hereafter "TH3") is one of
[three test harnesses](testing.html#harnesses) used for testing SQLite.
TH3 meets the following objectives:


* TH3 is able to run on embedded platforms that lack the support
 infrastructure of workstations.
* TH3 tests SQLite in an as\-deployed configuration using only
 published and documented interfaces.
 In other words, TH3 tests the compiled object code, not
 the source code, thus verifying that no problems were introduced
 by compiler bugs. "Test what you fly and fly what you test."
* TH3 checks SQLite's response to out\-of\-memory errors, disk I/O
 errors, and power loss during transaction commit.
* TH3 exercises SQLite in a variety of run\-time configurations
 (UTF8 vs UTF16, different pages sizes, varying journal modes, etc.)
* TH3 achieves 100% branch test coverage (and 100% 
 [MC/DC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_condition/decision_coverage))
 over the SQLite core.
 (Test coverage of extensions such as FTS and RTREE is less than 100%).


TH3 was originally written for validation testing only, but has
subsequently been used for development testing and debugging
as well, and has proven very helpful in those roles. A full\-coverage
test takes less than five minutes on a workstation and hence
serves as a fast regression test during day\-to\-day maintenance
of the SQLite code base.
