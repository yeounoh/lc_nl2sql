# 4\. Test Coverage


Using one particular subset of the available TH3 test modules (the "cov1"
tests) SQLite obtained 
[100% branch test coverage](testing.html#coverage) and 100% [MC/DC](testing.html#mcdc) as measured
by [gcov](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html)
on Linux x86 and x86\_64 hardware. All releases of SQLite since
[version 3\.6\.17](releaselog/3_6_17.html) (2009\-08\-10\) have been tested to this standard. 
The SQLite developers 
are committed to maintaining 100% branch coverage and MC/DC for all 
future releases of SQLite.


The cov1 test set used to obtain 100% branch test coverage are only a
subset of the tests currently implemented using TH3\. New test modules are
added on a regular basis.
