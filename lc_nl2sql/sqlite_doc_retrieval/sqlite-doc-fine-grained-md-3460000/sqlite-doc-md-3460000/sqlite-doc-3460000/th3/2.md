## 1\.1\. History


TH3 originated from an effort to test SQLite on 
[SymbianOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian).
Prior to TH3, all SQLite tests were run using the
[TCL](http://www.tcl.tk/) script language, but TCL would not (easily)
compile on SymbianOS which made testing difficult. The first attempt
to remedy this problem was the "TH1" (Test Harness \#1\) scripting 
language \- a reimplementation of parts of the TCL language in a 
more portable form that would compile and run on SymbianOS, and 
that was sufficient to run the SQLite tests. TH1
did not survive as a standard testing tool for SQLite,
but it did find continued service as a
scripting language used to customize the 
[Fossil](http://www.fossil-scm.org/) version control system.
There was also a "Test Harness \#2" which was an attempt to
create a simple scripting language using operator prefix notation
to drive tests. TH3 was the third attempt.



At about that same time, some avionics manufacturers were
expressing interest in SQLite, which prompted the SQLite developers
to design TH3 to support the rigorous testing standards of
[DO\-178B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DO-178B).



The first code for TH3 was laid down on 2008\-09\-25\.
An intense effort over the next 10 months resulted in TH3 achieving
100% MC/DC on 2009\-07\-25\. The TH3 code continues to be improved and
expanded.



As of 2018\-05\-19, the TH3 source tree consists 
and well over 500,000 lines of source code in 1709 separate files.
