# 5\. If You Insist On Rigid Type Enforcement...


As of SQLite version 3\.37\.0 (2021\-11\-27\), SQLite supports this
development style using [STRICT tables](stricttables.html).



If you find a real\-world case where STRICT tables prevented or
would have prevented a bug in an application, please post a message to the
[SQLite Forum](https://sqlite.org/forum/forum) so that we can add your story
to this document.
