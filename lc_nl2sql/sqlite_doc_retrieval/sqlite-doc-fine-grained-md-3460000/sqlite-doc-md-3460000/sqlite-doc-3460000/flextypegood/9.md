## 3\.6\. Repurposing unused or disused columns in legacy databases


 Because an SQLite database file is a single file on disk, some
applications use SQLite as an [application file format](appfileformat.html). This means
that a single instance of the application might, over the course of its
life, talk to hundreds or thousands of separate databases, each in a separate
file. When such applications evolve over years, some columns in the
underlying database will have their meanings altered subtly. Or, it might
be desirable to repurpose an existing column to serve two or more purposes.
This is much easier to do if the column has a flexible datatype.
