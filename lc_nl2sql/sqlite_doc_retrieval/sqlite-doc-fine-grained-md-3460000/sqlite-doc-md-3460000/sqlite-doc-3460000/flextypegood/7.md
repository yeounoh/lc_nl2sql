## 3\.4\. Dynamic programming languages


SQLite began as a TCL extension that later escaped into the wild.
TCL is a dynamic language in the sense that the programmer does not need
to be aware of datatypes. Under the hood, TCL keeps careful track of the
datatype of every value, but to the developer and user of a TCL program,
everything looks like a string. Flexible typing is a natural fit for
use with dynamic programming languages like TCL and others, since with
a dynamic programming language, you can not always predict in advance what
datatype a variable will hold. So when you need to store the value of that
variable into the database, having a database that supports flexible
typing makes storage much easier.
