## 3\.1\. Attribute tables


 Many applications, especially those that use SQLite as an
[application file format](appfileformat.html), need a place to store miscellaneous attributes
such as thumbnail images (as BLOB values), short pieces of text (such
as the user's name), as well as numeric, date, and JSON values. It is
convenient to create a single table to handle this storage:




```
CREATE TABLE attribute(name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value) WITHOUT ROWID;

```

Without flexible typing, such a table would need to be more complex,
with separate columns for each possible type of data. Flexible typing
of the "value" column makes the table conceptually simpler, more
space\-efficient, and easier to access and update.



In the [Fossil version control system](https://fossil-scm.org/), each
repository has a CONFIG table that is used to store all kinds of settings
with every possible datatype. The user\-specific configuration file
for Fossil (the \~/.fossil file) is a separate SQLite database that contains
a single attribute table hold the user\-specific state across all
repositories.



 Some applications use an SQLite database as a pure key\-value store
The database schema contains a single table that looks something like this:




```
CREATE TABLE storage(name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value ANYTHING);

```
