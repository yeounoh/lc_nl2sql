## 3\.2\. The "value" column output from the json\_tree virtual tables


The [json\_tree](json1.html#jtree) and [json\_each](json1.html#jeach) table\-valued functions that are
built into SQLite both have a "value" column that can hold values of
type INTEGER, REAL, or TEXT depending on the type of the corresponding
JSON field. For example:




```
SELECT typeof(value) FROM json_each('{"a":1,"b":2.5,"c":"hello"}');

```

The query above returns three rows of one column with values
"integer", "real", and "text", respectively.
