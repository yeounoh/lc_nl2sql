## 4\.4\. Other SQL database engines don't work this way


 Because SQLite is less restrictive and allows you to do more things,
SQL scripts that work on other database engines will also usually work
on SQLite, but script written initially for SQLite might not work
on more restrictive database engines. This can cause problems when
developers use SQLite for prototyping and testing and then migrate their
application to a more restrictive SQL engine for deployment. If the
application was (unintentionally) taking advantage of the flexible
typing available in SQLite, then it will fail when migrated.



 People use this problem to argue that SQLite should be more
restrictive about datatypes. But you could just as easily turn
that argument around and say that other database engines should be
more flexible with regard to datatypes. The application was working
correctly under SQLite, prior to be migrated, after all. If rigid
type enforcement is really all that useful, why did it break an
application that was previously working?
