## 3\.5\. Data typename cross\-compatibility


Every SQL database engine seems to have its own unique set of supported
datatype names:



* BIGINT
* UNSIGNED SMALL INT
* TEXT
* VARCHAR
* VARYING CHARACTER
* NATIONAL VARYING CHARACTER
* NVARCHAR
* JSON
* REAL
* FLOAT
* DOUBLE PRECISION
* *... and so forth ...*


The fact that SQLite will accept any of these names as a valid typename,
and let you store any kind of content into the column, increases the chances
that a script written to run on some other SQL database engine will also
work in SQLite.
