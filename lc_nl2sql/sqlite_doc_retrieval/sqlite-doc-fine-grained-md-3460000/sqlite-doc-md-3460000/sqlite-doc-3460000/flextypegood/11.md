## 4\.1\. We've never done it that way before


 Many skeptics of flexible typing simply express
shock and disbelief, without offering any rationale for why they think
flexible typing is a bad idea. Without supporting arguments, one must
assume their reason for not liking flexible typing is that it is different
from what they are used to.



 Presumably, many developers who are aghast at SQLite's flexible
typing feel this way because they have just never encountered anything
like it before. All prior exposure to databases and especially SQL
databases has involved rigid typing, and the readers mental model of
SQL includes rigid typing as a fundamental feature. Flexible typing
upsets their world\-view.



 Yes, flexible typing is a new way of thinking about data in an
SQL database. But new is not necessary bad. Sometimes, and I think
especially in the case of flexible typing, innovation leads to improvement.
