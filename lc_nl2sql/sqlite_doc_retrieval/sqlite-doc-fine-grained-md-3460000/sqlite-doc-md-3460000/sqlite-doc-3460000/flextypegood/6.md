## 3\.3\. Storage for dirty data


 Analysts sometimes encounter CSV files where some columns contain
a mixture of integer, real, and text data. CSV files that are obtained
from Excel spreadsheet exports commonly have this trait, for example.
When importing such "dirty data" into an SQL database, it is convenient
to have flexibly typed columns to import into.



 Dirty data is not restricted to CSV files coming out of Excel, of
course. There are many data sources in which a single field might
contain a mix of types. For example, a data column might contain the number
of seconds since 1970 sometimes, or a text date string in other cases.
It is desirable to clean up these inconsistent representations,
but at the same time it is convenient to be able to store all the different
representations in the same column of the intermediate database while the
cleanup is underway.
