# 6\. Embrace Freedom


If flexible typing in an SQL database is a new concept to you,
I encourage you to give it a try. It probably will not cause you
any problems and it might make your program simpler and easier to
write and maintain. I think that even if you are skeptical at first,
if you will just give flexible typing a try, you will eventually
come to realize that it is a better approach and will start
encouraging other database vendors to support at least an ANY
datatype if not complete SQLite\-style type flexibility.



Most of the time, flexible typing does not matter because a column
stores a single well\-defined type. But occasionally you will run
across situations where having a flexible type system makes the
solution to your problem cleaner and easier.
