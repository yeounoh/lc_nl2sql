# 2\. SQL Is A Programming Language



The best way to understand how SQL database engines work is to
think of SQL as a programming language, not as a "query language".
Each SQL statement is a separate program. Applications construct
SQL program source files and send them to the database engine.
The database engine compiles the SQL source code into executable
form, runs that executable, then sends the result back to the
application.




While SQL is a programming language, it is different from other
programming languages like C, Javascript, Python, or Go in that
SQL is a 
[declarative language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)
where the others are
[imperative languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming).
This is an important difference that has implications for the
design of the compiler used to translate program source text into an
executable format. However, those details 
should not detract from the fact that
SQL is really just another programming language.
